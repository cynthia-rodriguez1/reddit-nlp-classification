"" but many health experts are predicting  the 2022-2023 flu season will be a severe one. a big reason? australia,  which is in the southern hemisphere and experiences its flu season  before ours, had a doozy of a flu season.  

the country had its worst flu season in five years, with cases being three times higher than average according to [government surveillance reports](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/cda-surveil-ozflu-flucurr.htm#:~:text=a%20decrease%20in%20influenza%2dlike,a%20diagnosis%20date%20this%20fortnight.). flu cases also peaked about two months earlier than usual, signaling the country had an early onslaught of the flu.

for those of use who have succumbed to a japanese-like mask-wearing culture, good masks like n-95s can lower the risk of a flu infection significantly.

not all flu vaccines are the same.  there are high-dose vaccines, mostly recommended for those age 65 and over, and only one of these, flublok, is a recombinant vaccine.  flublok doesn't use eggs in the vaccine manufacturing process, so the targeted flu virus isn't subject to incubation ""drift,"" which can lower vaccine effectiveness.  flublok, which also is recommended for those with egg allergies, also is available for those under age 65 and age 18 and over.  while medicare will cover the extra expense of this vaccine, other insurance plans may not cover the full expense.  many pharmacies encourage those age 65 and over to get fluzone high-dose quadrivalent vaccine in stead of flublok, but pharmacies such as giant eagle will order flublok if they don't have available.  reportedly, in past years, flublok was readily available at kroger pharmacies.

"" yes, for some people. for the 2022-2023 flu season, there are three flu  vaccines that are preferentially recommended for people 65 years and  older. these are [fluzone high-dose‚ÄØquadrivalent vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/qa_fluzone.htm), [flublok quadrivalent recombinant ‚ÄØflu vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/qa_flublok-vaccine.htm) and [fluad quadrivalent adjuvanted flu vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/adjuvant.htm).  this recommendation was based on a review of available studies which  suggests that, in this age group, these vaccines are potentially more  effective than standard dose unadjuvanted flu vaccines. there is no  preferential recommendation for people younger than 65 years. ""

[https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/qa\_fluzone.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/qa_fluzone.htm)

flublok recombinant vaccine ""also avoids mutations that can occur when viruses are grown in eggs,  which can sometimes affect how well the finished vaccine works.

issue 1 would require the courts to consider public safety when setting the amount of bail.

opponents say that bail is a false sense of safety. violent criminals with enough money can pay bail and be out on the streets while non-violent criminals who are not able to pay languish in jail.

so i recently visited ohio. very briefly, i‚Äôll give it that. i was driving from chicago to erie, pa. i stopped in cleveland for a bit. i thought i‚Äôd just stick to the highway because all i‚Äôve ever heard my whole life is ‚Äúomg cleveland is a shithole!!1‚Äù

i actually had to make a few stops in the city and was pleasantly surprised by cleveland. driving along the lakeside and seeing the skyline was very magical. then there‚Äôs churches and old houses everywhere. and when i researched it more- cleveland has a subway ! and it has a national park! holy cats! like- it has all this and people want to act like the city is garbage?

anyway i‚Äôve recently looked into all the ohio cities and columbus, cincinnati also seem dope as well- 

and yet all i ever hear is people making jokes about ohio. on reddit, on tik tok- a girl at work i know lives in ohio (remote work) and she‚Äôs always saying negative things about.

and while all this is happening i‚Äôm seriously considering a move to the west side of cleveland i liked it that much. public (albeit limited) transport that takes you to downtown and the airport. cheap rent, walkable, and can get to the lake. i feel like cleveland is the kind of place people are looking for in america these days but no one wants to give it a chance.

91,ohio,clevelanders perspective on cincinnati,"born and raised in ne ohio and recently just lived in cleveland for a couple years. i was under the impression that cleveland was nicer than cincy! well, i'm only going off of a weekend trip to the queen city but damn i really like cincy! my gf and i parked off of mcmicken and basically walked all down race into down town then cut across the river front to get on the purple people bridge. we got lunch at pompilios in newport then walked over to covington, across the roebling bridge and then up vine st. to our car.

some standouts:

* over the rhine is a beautiful neighborhood. in cleveland half that neighborhood would be surface parking lots. it honestly might be one of the prettiest neighborhoods in the us.
* purple people bridge and roebling bridge are so amazing. my gf and i both lived in brooklyn and love walking across the brooklyn bridge so getting to see another roebling bridge is such an amazing experience
* newport and covington are such nice towns. loved the area right around the roebling bridge especially the bookstore
* findlay market area is wonderful and the fact that there isnt a sea of asphalt around it makes it feel like a real urban market
* light rail/protected bike lanes
* deeper roots coffee. had the cherry cordial twice! once in the morning and then again on the walk back to our car.
* washington park. there was a farmers market going on and it was just a beautiful green space that we could have hung out for hours in.
* rhinegeist brewery. speaks for itself. mysterious ascent up staircase gives way to a really cool lot level that was a big surprise. great beer as an rooftop as well.
* bookstores. i think we went into three bookstores on out walk and each was distinct in its own way. love that cincy is so walkable for shop browsing.
* pompilios is great italian american food and huge portions!
* underground railroad history. cant wait to visit the underground railroad freedom center on our next trip. we stayed at a underground railroad bed n breakfast north of the city and the history was quite informative and powerful. would love to learn more on our next trip.

room for improvement

* the area around 71 and the stadiums kinda sucks. the entire walk was fun except for the area near the freeway and the reds stadium. was starting to lose hope until we finally got the purple people bridge. once we got there is was gravy for the most part. the river front park looked really nice from the bridge though!
* a train linking cleveland to cincy would be amazing. so sad that it got scrapped a decade ago. the drive isnt bad but taking a quick train would be even better. and your light rail would help move people from the station to wherever they need to go.
* curious if there were plans to expand the light rail. would be so cool to have it go across the river in covington and newport.
* there's a cool looking theatre on mcmicken and mohawk that looks like it could be restored. seemed like the neighborhood could support a small community movie theatre.

(3) this is opposed to nuclear power which has no health risks for those living near by it's plants. radiation doesn't leak from outside the facility and nuclear waste is housed safely in containment facilitys. (4) in light of these public health concerns how can ohio citizens push our elected representatives and business leaders to increase our use of nuclear power as way to reduce our reliance on coal?

133,ohio,moving to ohio -- akron specifically," 

my wife (31f) and i (30m) moved to boise from louisiana in 2017 and have really enjoyed ourselves but it's time to move on. the city's growth is ridiculous, housing is absurd, and my wife and i don't make terribly much money (above median household, but not by that much).

we are looking to move somewhere, and, as crazy as this sound, akron checks almost every box statistically. i've read that akron is awesome, and i've also read that it is a shithole. i doubt it's as awesome as boise and i doubt it's as big a shithole as our hometown (alexandria, la), so i am good with somewhere in the middle.

i'm okay if the town is stagnant. i'm an accountant, and i feel like between akron, cleveland, and canton i can find work somewhere. my wife has a work from home job and one of their locations is in canton so she is eligible to transfer.

this might be weird, but we don't want somewhere that's growing. we just spent the last half a decade in a town where the growth was so much it was unsustainable. we are trying to find a town off the radar of any lists of any sort. our goals are to buy a house and be boring people in a boring town.

we don't have enough cheddar to visit beforehand. we could swing a trip, but we'd rather save the money for setting up shop. we are moving april 2023 when our lease is up.

i guess my general questions are:

i'm an accountant, but i'll need a general job when i get there before looking for work if i don't land a position while in boise. i know amazon has a presence, but any local companies that churn employees or expect high turnover?

how bad are the winters? i'd eventually like to be snowed in. after 25 years of heat in louisiana, boise is not nearly cold enough. what are the chances i'm holed up with nothing to do for weeks at a time?

is the local population nice? i'm tired of nice people. everybody here is so goddamn nice and bubbly it makes me want to vomit. will people ignore us, generally?

repeat of the op, but how does the city feel? we would like an area where it feels like it will never truly be on the upswing. not to say there aren't good things, but is it a place where people will say 'why in the world would you move here?'

how big are the universities presence (kent/akron) and do they bleed into all parts of the city? there are so many bsu students here (i was one just a year ago) and i'd like to know pockets of the city where the populace is older.

property management companies to avoid like the plague?

any good food places?

also, any other info is appreciated. i hope this doesn't come off as miserable, i just get seasonal affective disorder in the summer and it feels like it's rained not at all here for the past 3 months. we aren't miserable people, we are tried of feeling like people won't stop smiling at us every time we pass them on the street.

the ohio state capital has been proudly flying the ukranian flag since the conflict started. so if a lady wants to wear her ukranian flag peacefully, she should be able to do so. if russian tennis players aren't happy with that, they should stick to playing in north korea or iran, or whatever despotic country russia is sidling up against.

tonight, me, my wife and daughter went out to dinner.

we go in, we order and my daughter goes to the bathroom.

she comes back, pale as a ghost, and is bawling. 

my wife gets out of her that she just saw her rapist. he was working as a cook in the restaurant.

my daughter was ""date raped"" a year ago. long story short, my daughter wasn't mentally able to go to trial after his defense attorney indicated there would be a jury trial and a ton of the prosecutions case depended on my daughters testimony. 

a deal was struck and due to his age (literary by two weeks at the time) he's not on the predator list. 

he did some jail time, 3 years of probation, and a 5 year civil protection order. he has to maintain 500' of distance. no direct or indirect contact. no unsupervised contact with juveniles.  

back to tonight, when my daughter came out, we got up and left. 

we ordered about $65 worth of food and i feel bad about leaving.

the more i thought about it, the more it seemed like he was told he had to retreat if we came into a place he worked. 

so, i'm thinking i should have said something to the manager or the waitress, something as to why we left.

for my research paper i need to ask one question to people who own or work in a restaurant, it related with the whole economic situation as we dive more and more into an electrified future. 

the question: ""when you throw away food, trash, waste, whatever it is. how much do you actually throw away?""

178,ohio,"ohio should become a ""no chase"" state","cincinnati recently became a ""no chase"" city, where it is no longer policy for police to chase a fleeing vehicle, unless it is believed the driver has committed a felony.

i think ohio should adopt this as a statewide policy for all police. regardless of what you think about the recent police shootings, including jayland walker, high speed chases lead to a greater risk of people getting hurt or killed, especially bystanders, and other people on the road.

i'll post some statistics in the comments.",smartnsad,7,85

i know the answer; changing the law would require the state government to actually care about anything but the status quo and taking rights away from people who aren't male, white and a corporation.

i don't expect a cogent response from the comments, but i'm going to post this anyway.

183,ohio,the supreme court has agreed to hear moore v. harper which could mean they're going to make what the republicans did with the maps legal...,"the u.s. supreme court on thursday agreed to hear a republican-backed appeal that could give state legislatures far more power over federal elections by limiting the ability of state courts to review their actions, taking up a north carolina case that could have broad implications for the 2024 elections and beyond. 

...

the north carolina republicans' defense of the legislature's map relies on a contentious legal theory called the ""independent state legislature doctrine"" that is gaining traction in conservative legal circles and, if accepted, would vastly increase politicians' control over how elections are conducted.

**what is the inde¬≠pend¬≠ent state legis¬≠lature theory?**¬†¬†

the inde¬≠pend¬≠ent state legis¬≠lature theory is a read¬≠ing of the consti¬≠tu¬≠tion, pushed in recent years by a small group of advoc¬≠ates, that would give state legis¬≠latures wide author¬≠ity to gerry¬≠mander elect¬≠oral maps and pass voter suppres¬≠sion laws. it has even been used as polit¬≠ical cover to try to over¬≠turn elec¬≠tions.

the consti¬≠tu¬≠tion deleg¬≠ates power to admin¬≠is¬≠ter federal elec¬≠tions to the states, subject to congres¬≠sional over¬≠ride. there is, however, a disagree¬≠ment about how much power is deleg¬≠ated and to which state actors exactly.

there are two relev¬≠ant clauses. one is the elec¬≠tions clause, which reads, ‚Äúthe times, places and manner of hold¬≠ing elec¬≠tions for senat¬≠ors and repres¬≠ent¬≠at¬≠ives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legis¬≠lature thereof; but the congress may at any time by law make or alter such regu¬≠la¬≠tions.‚Äù

the other is the pres¬≠id¬≠en¬≠tial elect¬≠ors clause, which reads, ‚Äúeach state shall appoint, in such manner as the legis¬≠lature thereof may direct, a number of elect¬≠ors.‚Äù

the dispute hinges on how to under¬≠stand the word ‚Äúlegis¬≠lature.‚Äù the long-running under¬≠stand¬≠ing is that it refers to each state‚Äôs general lawmak¬≠ing processes, includ¬≠ing all the normal proced¬≠ures and limit¬≠a¬≠tions. so if a state consti¬≠tu¬≠tion subjects legis¬≠la¬≠tion to being blocked by a governor‚Äôs veto or citizen refer¬≠en¬≠dum, elec¬≠tion laws can be blocked via the same means. and state courts must ensure that laws for federal elec¬≠tions, like all laws, comply with their state consti¬≠tu¬≠tions.

proponents of the inde¬≠pend¬≠ent state legis¬≠lature theory reject this tradi¬≠tional read¬≠ing, insist¬≠ing that these clauses give state legis¬≠latures exclus¬≠ive and near-abso¬≠lute power to regu¬≠late federal elec¬≠tions. the result? when it comes to federal elec¬≠tions, legis¬≠lat¬≠ors would be free to viol¬≠ate the state consti¬≠tu¬≠tion and state courts could¬≠n‚Äôt stop them.

extreme versions of the theory would block legis¬≠latures from deleg¬≠at¬≠ing their author¬≠ity to offi¬≠cials like governors, secret¬≠ar¬≠ies of state, or elec¬≠tion commis¬≠sion¬≠ers, who currently play import¬≠ant roles in admin¬≠is¬≠ter¬≠ing elec¬≠tions.

**what would happen if the supreme court accep¬≠ted the inde¬≠pend¬≠ent state legis¬≠lature theory?**

the inde¬≠pend¬≠ent state legis¬≠lature theory would cause signi¬≠fic¬≠ant disrup¬≠tion by poten¬≠tially nulli¬≠fy¬≠ing state consti¬≠tu¬≠tional provi¬≠sions regard¬≠ing federal elec¬≠tions. state consti¬≠tu¬≠tional bans on gerry¬≠man¬≠der¬≠ing in¬†flor¬≠ida,¬†ohio,¬†north caro¬≠lina, and other states could die, as could inde¬≠pend¬≠ent redis¬≠trict¬≠ing commis¬≠sions in arizona, cali¬≠for¬≠nia, michigan and other states. other state consti¬≠tu¬≠tional provi¬≠sions ‚Äî like the right to a secret ballot in many states ‚Äî could also be wiped out.

deleg¬≠a¬≠tions of author¬≠ity would also be ques¬≠tion¬≠able, robbing elec¬≠tions commis¬≠sions and secret¬≠ar¬≠ies of state of the power to make decisions, includ¬≠ing in emer¬≠gen¬≠cies. and only federal courts would have the power to review gerry¬≠man¬≠der¬≠ing or voter suppres¬≠sion claims relat¬≠ing to federal elec¬≠tions.

the night¬≠mare scen¬≠ario is that a legis¬≠lature, displeased with how an elec¬≠tion offi¬≠cial on the ground has inter¬≠preted her state‚Äôs elec¬≠tion laws, would invoke the theory as a pretext to¬†refuse to certify¬†the results of a pres¬≠id¬≠en¬≠tial elec¬≠tion and instead select its own slate of elect¬≠ors. indeed, this isn‚Äôt far from¬†the plan¬†attemp¬≠ted by trump allies follow¬≠ing his loss in the 2020 elec¬≠tion. and, accord¬≠ing to former federal judge¬†j. michael luttig¬†‚Äî a distin¬≠guished conser¬≠vat¬≠ive jurist ‚Äî the theory is a part of the ‚Äúrepub¬≠lican blue¬≠print to steal the 2024 elec¬≠tion.‚Äù

these high stakes under¬≠score the signi¬≠fic¬≠ance of the chal¬≠lenge the inde¬≠pend¬≠ent state legis¬≠lature theory presents to the courts.

[https://www.10tv.com/article/sports/abby-steiner-gold-medal-us-4x100-meter-relay-world-championships/530-4c8a4525-c132-4870-be9e-feb8ccd11f54](https://www.10tv.com/article/sports/abby-steiner-gold-medal-us-4x100-meter-relay-world-championships/530-4c8a4525-c132-4870-be9e-feb8ccd11f54)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mncilal\_3yo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mncilal_3yo)

whereas  the u.s. 4x100 relay team was the underdog against defending champion jamaica, with superstar sydney  mclaughlin anchoring the 4x400 team, the u.s. team was the prohibitive  favorite in the longer relay.

[https://www.dispatch.com/story/sports/pro/2022/07/24/abby-steiner-united-states-wins-gold-4-x-400-meter-relay/10139848002/](https://www.dispatch.com/story/sports/pro/2022/07/24/abby-steiner-united-states-wins-gold-4-x-400-meter-relay/10139848002/)

it's  doubtful any american woman ever won two relay gold medals in a single  world championships before steiner, but surprisingly, the nbc  commentators never addressed this point, as they were totally obsessed  with mclaughlin.

steiner, a 2022  kentucky grad, definitely has emerged as one of the top u.s. track &amp;  field stars in her first professional season.

i want to know the laws on recording myself as i walk from house to house with a body camera. i'd like a record of what i actually do, so that if someone catches me off guard a d things get physical i know it's recorded.

267,ohio,stop saying ohio is affordable,"yes, the country on the whole is in a housing crisis.

no, most of ohio is not seeing it to the same degree at the moment. homeownership is still a possibility here without having your rich uncle with no kids croak off and give you his inheritance (maybe you need that rich uncle to buy in columbus, though).

that said, with other metros in the us being unaffordable, the rise in remote work, and a warming planet, we will likely see an influx of people in the coming decades.

which will cause housing prices to rise, and low availability.

some might see that as a positive. especially those who already own a home. but having out-of-towners swarm here is going to cause the same housing issues that are already infecting other parts of the country (not to mention the traffic, the smog, and other issues this creates that reduces quality of life).

and this isn't just a west coast problem. look at the raleigh and denver metros. 20 years ago, buying there was a relative breeze for those earning a decent wage. now that everyone is moving to those locations, the average local with a good job can no longer afford to buy.

is this what we want in ohio? a housing market that is exploding, while wages stay the same?

if this becomes the case, the people who buy today will make out like bandits, but anyone who couldn't buy today (like, 12 year olds), will face a new reality where they are 32, college degree and a good job, but no ability to afford a house.

298,ohio,just venting about the gop senate candidates debate,"last evening's debate was dismal. is this the best we have? ohio sends two representatives to the u.s. senate and one of them will probably come from the sad array of bloviators on display. 

generally the questions were good. jane timken was asked why trump has not yet endorsed her. of course, she dodged the question, but at least the panelist gave her a chance to address it.

mandel: marine, marine, marine. did you know he was a marine? by the way, he was a marine. opportunist of the highest order: perhaps we should elect him to something so he'll go away.

gibbons: hectoring grandpa. doesn't seem at all happy to he there. 

timken: ""i'm a mom. vote for me because i'm a mom.""

vance: sinking like a stone. runs tv ads denigrating 'the elites' when he graduated with a law degree from an ivy league school. promises to accomplish things that even putin doesn't have the power to do. at least he's honest about his rhino-ness. 

the other guy (dolan): dresses in glenn youngkin republican casual. likes to hang out with police. wants to put everyone in jail. at least he served in the ohio house and he's not in jail. yet.

312,ohio,breakdown of changes to the law in ohio regarding carrying a concealed weapon,"some of the news coverage on this issue has not been complete and make people think the law did more than it actually did so i wanted to do a breakdown so everyone can be properly informed.

the law that was passed is sb215 and can be found [here](https://search-prod.lis.state.oh.us/solarapi/v1/general_assembly_134/bills/sb215/en/05/sb215_05_en?format=pdf).

the bill made two big changes. first, anyone can carry a firearm concealed without a license though this comes with restrictions i'll get into later. second, a person is not required to disclose to an officer that they are in possession of a firearm unless asked. 

the first part comes from a new law created by the bill. this new law is o.r.c. 2923.111. it basically states that for the purposes of the ccw statute (2923.12) everyone is considered to have a ccw license so long as they are 21 or over and have no disqualifying conditions that would be found under 2923.13 (hwwud) or 18 u.s.c. 922(g)(1)-(9). 

the issues that can cause a disability under 2923.13 are: 
1)	the person is a fugitive from justice.
2)	they are under indictment for or have been convicted of a felony offense of violence, or adjudicated a delinquent child for an offense of violence.
3)	the person is under indictment or has been convicted of any felony offense for the possession or trafficking of a drug of abuse or has been adjudicated a delinquent child for what would be a felony offense for the possession or trafficking of a drug of abuse.
4)	the person is drug dependent, in danger of drug dependence, or a chronic alcoholic.
5)	the person is under adjudication of mental incompetence, has been adjudicated mental defective, has been committed to a mental institution, has been found by a court to be a mentally ill person subject to court order or is an involuntary patient other than one who is a patient only for purposes of observation.

18 u.s.c. 922(g)(1)-(9) is the federal statute that prohibits firearm ownership. the issues that would cause a disability under this statute are:
1)	a person with any felony conviction
2)	a person who is a fugitive from justice
3)	a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance
4)	a person who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to a mental institution
5)	a person who is illegally or unlawfully in the united states or present in the us on a nonimmigrant visa
6)	a person who has been dishonorably discharged from the armed forces
7)	a person who has renounced their us citizenship
8)	a person subject to a protection order issued to protect an intimate partner or child of the person
9)	a person convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence

it should be noted that the disabilities under 18 u.s.c. 922(g) already kept someone from having a ccw license prior to the law change.
 
in my opinion, the thing that so often gets left out of news articles on the law is that it is still illegal to have a loaded firearm ready at hand in a motor vehicle. the only change to the improper handling law, r.c. 2923.16, was to no longer require a person to volunteer that they have a firearm with them in a car. all the other parts of the law were unchanged. so you still need to obtain a ccw license in order to possess a loaded firearm in a car. and to be clear, if the gun is in your center console, and the loaded magazine is in the glove box, then the gun is considered loaded under the law. 

now here's some general stuff to be aware of:

you still can't possess a firearm in a bar, a school safety zone, or a courthouse. a gun may be possessed at a private or public university if a written policy or rule permits it. same for a church or government building. a private employer may also prohibit firearm from the premises. you also may not possess a firearm while intoxicated. 

i hope this summary is helpful.",beiki,13,684

when you are successful and every kid wants to be lgbt and/or black.. the world will be a much much better place.

i'll be home schooling my kids personally but eh.

410,ohio,!national push to hire military spouses boosted in ohio,"ohio is the 20th state deemed a military spouse economic empowerment zone by the u.s. chamber of commerce ‚Äúhiring our heroes‚Äù program, state and program officials announced tuesday at the national veterans memorial museum in columbus.

&amp;#x200b;

retaining top talent in the military is closely linked to the availability of good jobs for military spouses, said brian alvarado, director of the hiring our heroes military spouse program and ‚Äúa proud military spouse‚Äù himself.

&amp;#x200b;

but only in recent years have there been effective efforts to address that issue, he said.

&amp;#x200b;

‚Äúthe military spouse community has been plagued by an unemployment rate of 20% for decades,‚Äù alvarado said.

&amp;#x200b;

that is exacerbated by an underemployment rate of more than 70%, as spouses often take jobs below their skill level due to frequent moves, lack of childcare and sparse opportunities in many places, he said. [^(no time to die 2021)](https://sites.google.com/flixfilm.club/watch-no-time-to-die-2021-stre/)

&amp;#x200b;

lt. gov. jon husted said the mseez initiative has three pillars: ‚Äúhire, train and navigate.‚Äù

&amp;#x200b;

that means connecting military spouses with potential employers, providing training to meet those companies‚Äô needs, and creating community networks to find local solutions to employment-related issues.

&amp;#x200b;

jobs for military spouses are of special importance in the dayton area due to the presence of wright-patterson air force base, which with more than 30,000 military and civilian employees is the largest single-site employer in ohio.

&amp;#x200b;

in september, the department of the air force ranked ohio in the middle tier of states for support of military families. state officials asked the air force to revisit that ranking, especially in light of sb 7.

&amp;#x200b;

in june 2020 dewine also signed house bill 16, which automatically gives students from families at wright-patt in-state college tuition.

&amp;#x200b;

colleen briggs, a co-chair of the ohio mseez leadership team and an operations manager for amazon, said when she moved to ohio 12 years ago with her active-duty husband, she struggled to overcome gaps in her resume and a need for childcare when she looked for a good job.

&amp;#x200b;

the 400 mawozo gang kidnapped the group ‚Äî which also included some elderly people ‚Äî in ganthier, a commune that lies east of the capital of port-au-prince, haitian police inspector frantz champagne told the associated press.

&amp;#x200b;

the gang, whose name roughly translates to 400 ‚Äúinexperienced men,‚Äù controls the croix-des-bouquets area that includes ganthier, where they carry out kidnappings and carjackings and extort business owners, according to authorities.

&amp;#x200b;

haiti is once again struggling with a spike in gang-related kidnappings that had diminished in recent months, after president jovenel mo√Øse was fatally shot at his private residence on july 7 and a 7.2-magnitude earthquake killed more than 2,200 people in august.

nearly a year ago, haitian police issued a wanted poster for the gang‚Äôs alleged leader, wilson joseph, on charges including murder, attempted murder, kidnapping, auto theft, and the hijacking of trucks carrying goods. he goes by the nickname ‚Äúlanm√≤ sanjou,‚Äù which means ‚Äúdeath doesn‚Äôt know which day it‚Äôs coming.‚Äù

&amp;#x200b;

joseph, who could not be immediately reached for comment, [^(no time to die free)](https://bgh2.instructure.com/courses/5382/pages/watch-slash-free-star-007-no-time-to-die-2021-full-free-hd-download-online) has posted videos detailing the alleged crimes the gang has committed in recent years.

&amp;#x200b;

once, when the gang opened fire on a small bus carrying several passengers and killed an infant, wilson said it was not their fault because the bus driver refused to stop. in a more recent video, he appears holding a bottle of alcohol surrounded by heavily armed men. another video from june shows people inside a church fleeing as gunfire erupted outside on a saturday morning. the gang was accused of raiding the area and setting cars on fire.

&amp;#x200b;

the missionaries were on their way home saturday from building an orphanage, according to a message from ohio-based christian aid ministries sent to various religious missions.

&amp;#x200b;

‚Äúthis is a special prayer alert,‚Äù the one-minute message said. ‚Äúpray that the gang members would come to repentance.‚Äù

&amp;#x200b;

the message says the mission‚Äôs field director is working with the u.s. embassy, and that the field director‚Äôs family and one other unidentified man stayed at the ministry‚Äôs base while everyone else visited the orphanage.

&amp;#x200b;

a u.s. government spokesperson said officials were aware of the reports on the kidnapping.

&amp;#x200b;

‚Äúthe welfare and safety of u.s. citizens abroad is one of the highest priorities of the department of state,‚Äù the spokesperson said, declining to comment further.

&amp;#x200b;

meanwhile, a senior u.s. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the united states is in touch with haitian authorities to try to resolve the case.

&amp;#x200b;

gangs have demanded ransoms ranging from a couple of hundred dollars to more than $1 million, according to authorities.

&amp;#x200b;

last month, a deacon was killed in front of a church in the capital of port-au-prince and his wife kidnapped, one of dozens of people who have been abducted in recent months.

&amp;#x200b;

at least 328 kidnappings were reported to haiti‚Äôs national police in the first eight months of 2021, compared with a total of 234 for all of 2020, according to a report issued last month by the united nations integrated office in haiti known as binuh.

&amp;#x200b;

gangs have been accused of kidnapping schoolchildren, doctors, police officers, busloads of passengers and others as they grow more powerful. in april, a man who claimed to be the gang leader of the 400 mawozo told a radio station that they were the ones responsible for kidnapping five priests, two nuns and three relatives of one of the priests that month. they were later released.

&amp;#x200b;

a protest is scheduled for monday to decry the nation‚Äôs lack of security.

&amp;#x200b;

‚Äúpolitical turmoil, the surge in gang violence, deteriorating socioeconomic conditions ‚Äî including food insecurity and malnutrition ‚Äî all contribute to the worsening of the humanitarian situation,‚Äù binuh said in its report. ‚Äúan overstretched and under-resourced police force alone cannot address the security ills of haiti.‚Äù

&amp;#x200b;

on friday, the u.n. security council voted unanimously to extend the u.n. political mission in haiti.

&amp;#x200b;

the kidnapping of the missionaries comes just days after high-level u.s. officials visited haiti and promised more resources for haiti‚Äôs national police, including another $15 million to help reduce gang violence, which this year has displaced thousands of haitians who now live in temporary shelters in increasingly unhygienic conditions.

&amp;#x200b;

among those who met with haiti‚Äôs police chief was uzra zeya, u.s. undersecretary of state for civilian security, democracy, and human rights.

&amp;#x200b;

‚Äúdismantling violent gangs is vital to haitian stability and citizen security,‚Äù she recently tweeted.

definitely want to camp in a tent that would be close to my car, so that i could grab something if i needed it. what would be the best spot for this kind of camping? 

what are some things that are a ""must do"" when going to this area? i definitely want to hike a bunch of the trails and see the sights, but what are the ones that everyone should see?

are there any interesting historical sights or local shops that would be fun to go to?

miami had a chance at a two-possession lead with 2:10 remaining in the fourth quarter but graham nicholson missed a 51-yard field goal. the cardinals drove down to the miami 19 before weatherford‚Äôs interception sealed it.

brett gabbert was 20-of-24 passing for 207 yards and a pair of touchdowns for miami (4-4, 3-1 mid-american conference). gabbert connected with nate muersch on a 6-yard td, and the two-point conversion from gabbert to andrew homer gave miami seven-point lead in the fourth.

miami‚Äôs defense forced two turnovers and held ball state‚Äôs offense to just 327 yards. [^(haloween kills 2021 movie online full free)](https://gcsd.instructure.com/courses/8387/pages/peacocktv-streaming-watch-haloween-kills-2021-movie-online-full-free-hd)

now, i understand that there are certain situations in which that might seem reasonable, to withhold that kind of information, but when the person is in the er and the doctors want to know what meds the patient is on, what allergies they might have, etc., that need to be divulged. the er doctors are in the dark at that point, and my mom could have died.

446,ohio,[ohio] senate passes ‚Äòborn alive‚Äô bill with amendment that would close abortion clinics,"the  ohio senate passed a bill that would require doctors to provide  life-saving care to fetuses born alive during an abortion ‚Äî with an  amendment that could close two clinics in southwest ohio.

senate bill 157 passed 25 to 6 along party lines wednesday afternoon. it now heads to the house.

earlier  in the day, a senate committee amended the bill to make it harder for  abortion clinics to remain open under a variance to the requirement that  they obtain a written transfer agreement for emergencies ‚Äî one of  several requirements the ohio general assembly placed on abortion  clinics over the last decade.

some  abortion clinics remain open, even without transfer agreements, because  they enter consulting agreements with local physicians, requiring the  doctors to step in during times of emergency, and the ohio department of  health grants them variances to the transfer requirement.

under  the amendment, the ohio department of health would have to revoke the  variances if the consulting physicians teach or are employed by a  university, state hospital or other public institution.

women‚Äôs  med center in dayton and planned parenthood of southwest ohio‚Äôs clinic  in cincinnati operate under variances. if both clinics are forced to  close, women who live in that region would have to travel to get  abortions.

rep.  niraj antani, a dayton-area republican, said that women‚Äôs med center  has listed on its variant that it works with employees of wright state  university, a public college.

‚Äúwe  in the general assembly have the right to determine where our taxpayer  dollars go,‚Äù he said. ‚Äúand we don‚Äôt want them going to abortion.‚Äù

lauren  blauvelt-copelin, vice president of government affairs and public  advocacy at planned parenthood advocates of ohio, called the amendment  another restriction on abortion in ohio.

‚Äúthere  is no medical justification for disallowing qualified, experienced  physicians from agreeing to provide backup coverage for abortion  providers under a variance,‚Äù she said. ‚Äúin fact, if the state was  genuinely concerned for patient safety, such physicians would be ideal.  instead, this provision is only meant to make it more challenging for  abortion providers to remain licensed and operational.‚Äù [^(halloween)](https://www.rugbytatra.com/advert/123movie-watch-halloween-kills-2021-movie-streaming-online-full-free-hd/)",randonturges0,13,349

the app is called happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend.

504,ohio,resources for elderly person on the verge of being homeless due to mental illness,"hello ohioans,

i am looking for any advice you may have on social services that might be able to help my aunt, who we believe is on the verge of becoming homeless with brain damage and mental illness. 

my 67-year-old aunt:

* had a stroke 6 years ago which left her somewhat brain damaged
* has some kind of mental illness
* has stage 4 kidney disease, white matter disease, lyme disease and a few other medical issues
* abuses alcohol, cigarettes, and prescription drugs
* refuses services like a medicaid nursing home
* can do some things but doesn't clean up after herself, bathe regularly, manage finances, grocery shop or manage general life things.  
* has delusions about a man that is coming to rescue her from her current situation 
* is very adept at getting prescription drugs/cigarettes/alcohol. somehow her brain works fine for this. 
* is highly self destructive and also destructive to spaces she lives in, relationships, and really anything around her. 
* has almost no income except a tiny amount of ss

she has been kicked out of several senior living facilities because she will not follow the rules - namely  not smoking indoors or only smoking in designated areas.

my parents (also elderly) have been almost full-time taking care of her, babysitting her, cleaning up after her, feeding her, managing her (lack of) finances, and trying to find her housing.  they were able to luckily, with a lot of effort, get her into low income housing recently.  that's good news, but we are reasonably sure she will get kicked out soon because they don't allow smoking indoors and she won't follow any rules.  she also needs to be monitored frequently for basic life needs and not accidentally burning the place down. 

because of her mental illness/brain damage/drug abuse, it's impossible to reason with her or convince her to follow rules.  she just can't comprehend it or doesn't care.  she believes a man she has feelings for is about to come sweep her off her feet and buy her a condo so her behavior doesn't matter anyway. 

my parents quality of life is highly degraded due to having to manage my aunt's life and try to prevent her complete self-destruction.  my aunt absolutely cannot move in with them, and she would be an extreme burden to any person who took her in.  my aunt has also stated that if put into a nursing home she would just walk out.  

my parents called adult protective services hoping they would provide some kind of help to her (such as a caseworker who could get her assistance) as she was getting kicked out of her most recent housing, but after the appointment/interview with my aunt they just gave her a list of low-cost housing options.  (which was absolutely not something she could deal with on her own.)

at this point it feels like there are no other options for if/when she gets kicked out of her new low-income housing and will become homeless.  (even in housing her life is in a quite dire state.) when told this is the end of the road and the next stop is being homeless, she doesn't care because she thinks a rich man is about to buy her a condo. 

it feels like grasping at straws at this point, but i was wondering if anyone had any thoughts about services that could help my aunt - someone who refuses to abide by any rules or accept a medicaid nursing home but is also not mentally well enough to make positive choices for her life or manage her life at all. 

we don't want her to be homeless but we're at the end of the line and are feeling heartbroken. thanks to anyone who read this far.",traveler81,14,633

press release - july 3, 2021

it is clear and evident through the statement sent to our department that the officers of american legion post 464 intentionally censored lt. col bernard kemter, us army (ret.) during his memorial day speech hosted by american legion post 464 of hudson, ohio.  

this action was highly inconsiderate and proved to be a feeble judgment call made by the officers of post 464 and not at all aligned with the principles, pillars, and people, of the american legion.  not acknowledging or discussing history that involves people of a different race and color is akin to eliminating or making invisible the fact that people of color exist and were/are part of this vital piece of history regarding a ceremony that veterans, families of veterans, and community members, hold reverent.  

therefore, department commander roger friend asks for the resignation of james e. garrison, post 464 adjutant, and cindy suchan, auxiliary president of post 464 effective immediately.   a formal letter from commander roger friend has been sent to the said parties and a decision for the existence of this post and a trial-board hearing for this incident is currently pending.

554,ohio,a place worth exploring.,"if your bored and looking for a quick day trip downtown lancaster has really come alive in the past couple of years. the buildings look amazing and really capture the historical nature of the downtown. you could easily spend the afternoon just taking photos of the streets. there lots of nice shops, good restaurants, and even things to see and do.¬†i'm honestly amazed at the turn around.¬†


there are fun things to do like art&amp;clay where you can paint pottery. the sherman house and georgian are great museums for the mid 1800's. the shoe factory antique mall is an absolutely massive multifloor antique store that is just cool to explore. the decorative arts center of ohio is a really different take on an art museum with different traveling exhibits. there are even 4 art galleries to visit as well. if history and art really arnt your thing you can visit rising park and climb mt pleasant for a truly amazing view.¬†


while there are things to do i think most people visting the downtown will spend thier time in all the little shops. there's the paper back exchange an old book store, pulp reality which is a cool retro comic book and record store ( btw if your a local band this is the place to post concert flyers.) odessey games is a shop devoted to tabletop gaming with tables to play at. a season in time and sparkel &amp; rust both sell that old farm house looking decor that people are really into currently. keller market house has locally made food products and iv seriously been meaning to try double edge brewings locally made beer. this isn't even a tenth of all shops, its really like what old downtowns use to be.¬†


finally the downtown has a crazy amount of good restaurants and pubs to eat at. ale house 1890 and downtown bistro are your more up scale options, maria's is good mexican. ohuids is a pub straight out of ireland. jb's downtown grill, provisions, and bobs backyard bbq are great places for lunch. it's honestly impossible to name all the places to eat and drink there because new places just keep popping up. i suggest you just ask a local what nearby is good.¬†


what was once mostly half empty buildings is now a place the town really wants people to travel to see.¬†this a great place to just walk around with a coffee and explore. i strongly suggest you give it a vist and if you have already been there please tell us what your favorite shop/restaurant was.¬†",jcook311,4,433

she's very fit and extremely mindful of her diet, so i'm turning to you for help. i'm open to other ideas, but i've been wanting to send her a ""treat"" of sorts... something she can splurge on. i've been thinking the vegan version of tiff's treats, and i'd be completely fine with cannabis suggestions (assuming ohio allows for it, unlike my state... although we're getting close). 

will also look online, but i wanted to find any hidden local favorites that might not be on the top results of a google search.

then you try to contact via email and get an auto-repsonse that says  ""please note: any questions asked through email will not receive a response. if you have questions, please call...""

there's my rant....now my question/issue....

i have been receiving unemployment benefits since our restaurant was temporarily shut down back at the end of march(due to covid-19). since we reopened i have been getting some shifts, but still have qualified for partial unemployment due to reduced hours. there were two weeks in a row(3 weeks ago) where i was able to get enough hours that i didn't qualify for a payment.¬†

the following week i was back down to 1 shift of 6 hours(which would have qualified me again). up to this point i have not been required to do the 2 per week job searches. once i hit these two weeks in a row, it now made me reapply and is asking for me to meet the job search criteria.

more than likely, for the forseeable future, i will have 1-2 weeks where hours are below the threshold, then a week where it is above the threshold.

from my understanding, if this was due to the mass layoff because of covid-19, i am not required to do the job search.

with the 2020 election fast approaching, i wanted to share this resource that gives great, nonpartisan information on candidates‚Äô platforms. it is called the youthvoterguide and it is a great resource for young voters in this coming election.¬†

the way the youthvoterguide works is by typing in your zip code and then selecting your congressional district. this will give a side by side comparison of the republican and democrat running for congress in your district. the website gives the candidates‚Äô positions on many issues important to young people such as gun control, climate change, health care, and immigration just to name a few. the youthvoterguide also tells you if the race in your area is contested or not. with this information, voters can compare the closeness of the races in their home district and the district where they go to school and choose to register in the area where their vote will have a larger impact.¬†

ohio is one of the key battleground states of the upcoming election. winners of ohio elections will help determine the course of this country over the next several years. this makes it absolutely necessary to make sure that the young voters of ohio are informed on their candidates‚Äô positions. 

making sure that young voters are informed is just as important as having young people vote in the first place. please help spread awareness of the youthvoterguide so that they can make their right choice on election day.¬†

problem is, the ""on-call"" part makes it hard to factor on getting cash from a secondary source of income, so i was looking for something where i could make up my own hours. it hit me that things like doordash, uber eats, postmate, that kind of thing might actually be worth considering because i balance my time and schedule accordingly.

i live in a town that's barely on the map, between norwalk and ashland. huron county area. sandusky is definitely the ""biggest city"" near me. i'm super aware that all these delivery services would be a bust in my immediate area, but what if i went out to norwalk or sandusky? are they popular around there, or no? i've never used it myself, nor do i know anyone that does, but that's 'cause i like picking my own stuff up and mostly know a lot of people who aren't tech-literate. it's not something i figure on making a ""full-time job"" out of, but for supplemental income, is it viable out here?",blackstar-abyssal,14,240

2:05 pm: the governor begins speaking

today, i'm wearing a wright state university tie.

we are submitting a medicaid waiver application to the federal government in order to bolster telehealth, waiving signature requirements, easing obstacles to getting care in a nursing home, and access to alternative locations.

i want to help all of our mayors and local leaders as they report what's going on at a local level. i believe they are helping me and the rest of the state with all they're doing. 

i'm going to have andy ginther, the mayor of columbus to talk about what's been going on, including our build-out plans for hospitals. 

2:14 pm: the governor stops speaking
______________________________________________________________________
2:14 pm: andrew ginther, the mayor of columbus begins speaking

i had the opportunity to tour one of our build-out sites and it was simply amazing how quickly this has been done and how collaborative our hospital system has been. we're getting calls throughout the state and the country on how to do this sort of thing. i'd like to thank the national guard as well for their tremendous support. our greatest hope is that we never have to open these build-out sites and it's possible we won't if you keep following the stay at home orders and other guidelines. 

we're constantly focusing on collaboration and working for the common good. battelle is one example of a company that is doing what they can to keep ohioans safe but there are many companies throughout the state that are doing the same. 

while i'd like to open up the state as soon as possible, we absolutely must follow the advice of the medical community. we have to do this the right way to avoid a second surge. with this recovery, we have to keep in mind that not everyone is on the same level right now in terms of healthcare and that we must ensure that they are properly taken care of as well.

the office of small business relief has been sending out forgivable loans to small businesses throughout the state. it has helped 1,300 businesses so far.

i want to mention that along with the medical community, we are speaking to the businesses community in order to figure out what works and will work best to protect our economy. i always get asked when we're opening back up and i'd just like to say that i think we'd all love to know that answer. this isn't going to be a switch on from off. we have evidence of how the best practices are protecting workers and lowering the human and economic costs of continued operation. businesses need to ensure that they follow those best practices when the state reopens so that those practices can work with you as well.

there are more than 41,000 jobs in several industries that are critical to the continued operation of our supply chain.

2:30 pm: the lieutenant governor stops speaking
____________________________________________________________________________
2:30 pm: amy acton starts speaking

we hope that we've reached our plateau and hopefully that's the worst we'll have to face.

7,153 confirmed cases (127 with extra probable cases), 309/7,153 confirmed deaths (with 15 extra probable deaths), 2,156 hospitalizations, 654/2,033 in the icu, 1,534 of those infected were health care workers, 67,874 total tests

high risk categories that can cause increased risk of death include chronic lung diseases, moderate to severe asthma , obesity, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, heart conditions, and those that are immuno-compromised.

we will be issuing a new order in order to protect first responders. we are sharing information on the locations of positive cases with first responders, while still keeping that information as confidential as possible to protect privacy. 

we're still working on a plan for the recovery phase, but we have also created a collaborative environment throughout the ohio healthcare system, that we believe will be ready to go out to hot spots as they appear throughout the state. we've won the first battle but this is a war. we cannot stop just yet. this is a long road and there are more battles we have to fight. this hospital buildout is in preparation of those future battles that will appear as spikes in cases and possible deaths. 

staying at home is just as important as ever but i want you to remember that while we have to keep distance from each other that staying social with those you know is still important for everyone's mental health. i think we all feel angry about what is going on. i feel angry every moment i know that we don't have the exact details of this virus just yet. staying social will help you with that as i think it's helped me.

2:40 pm: amy acton stops speaking
_________________________________________________________________________
2:40 pm: question period begins

50 people from a small business have applied for unemployment and only four of the 50 have received the benefits they need. what do you have to say about that?

governor: this is very concerning and i apologize to those 46 individuals. i can go into the reasons why this is happening but i think what you want is for us to fix this and we're doing everything we can.

lieutenant governor: every time i hear a story like this i get even more frustrated because this isn't acceptable in any way. this is a difficult time and i feel the responsibility to help our citizens. i am not satisfied. i want to present more answers as to what is going on with our system but i'm going to take another day to figure this out. until then i will be doing everything i can to fix this.
____________________________________________________________________
2:44 pm: what would you say to the kids who are stuck at home and don't really understand any of this?

amy acton: i've thought about that a lot. we have to create new normals and routines without causing fear. unfortunately, kids are perceptive and can see our own fear and that makes everything even more difficult. i want to learn from the past and that tells me that this won't be a quick path. this is unsettling at the least, the job losses and the loss of stability are hurting our children. i hope that i will be able to find better answers and i will share everything i know as i know it. this isn't something i can look up and get an answer, it takes much more than one person to understand at this time. all i can say is that everything we've done in ohio has saved lives and we need to keep moving. we're still short on ppe and testing, two things that are essential to getting us to a place that will allow us greater freedoms. the best minds are working together on this. we're sticking with you as this goes on.
________________________________________________________________________
2:49 pm: what are you looking for to reopen? is there a magic number?

amy acton: what i know and what is agreed upon is a sustained decrease. ideally, we would like to contact trace everyone. i know we won't get to absolute zero. what i'm building is the ability to get the best numbers possible. we still don't have enough testing to figure out the total infected cases throughout the state or the country. each day we're gathering the best data we can and following trends, while we have eyes on the dashboards that are focusing on higher-risk areas so that we are ready to respond as necessary. we will need to build our infrastructure to fight against this illness. we are at the cutting edge of these discussions.
____________________________________________________________________
2:53 pm: what do you think about reopening college campuses? how will they practice social distancing?

governor: it's far too early to make any decisions about fall term. i don't know where our numbers will be, especially our number of tests. no matter what, when our education system reopens, the students' experience will be different. this may be difficult to accept but until we get a vaccine it will be a different environment. everyone needs to think about how to keep everyone safe when all of these industries and systems reopen. you need to start thinking about this right now. when is an important question but how is the question you need to focus on right now. everything looks good but our citizens are still dying and it's still very dangerous. i apologize for the long answer but this is what we need to focus on.
________________________________________________________________
2:58 pm: what budget cuts are you going to be a focusing on?

governor: we're not prepared to make an announcement on our budget cuts just yet. the highest priority is to keep the essential areas that are focusing on the coronavirus as funded as possible.
___________________________________________________________________________
2:59 pm: what kind of efforts are being made to keep grocery stores supplied with health supplies?

governor: we're all doing what we can. some stores are doing it themselves. we're also providing help as possible.

lieutenant governor:  our businesses are creating protocols, buying stock, organizing teams, and just doing everything they can to reopen. we cannot open until these businesses have completed that process. we have some amazing companies that are working globally to keep themselves open and prepared to be reopened. 
________________________________________________________________________
3:05 pm: we're hearing reports of families of individuals in nursing homes that have been waiting for days for test results. what do you have to say about that? should families be informing you about this?

amy acton: we have done a lot to keep things like that from happening. i'd like to hear more details.

governor: we have the capacity to get these tests back quickly. there is a problem there and i want to know what's going on. 

absolutely let us know if there are testing delays.
_______________________________________________________________________
3:07 pm: how will we avoid the coronavirus coming back into ohio after we reopen?

governor: we're used to a quick win but this monster will be with us until we get the vaccine. people are going to have to be careful. those in high-risk populations should probably avoid putting themselves in dangerous situations. this isn't just going to go away for quite some time. 
__________________________________________________________________________
3:10 pm: you have built up goodwill among ohioans but do you believe you will see a growing backlash as this goes on?

governor: i understand and see how this is frustrating. i want to get everything back open but i think that even if i opened everything up, people wouldn't go out at the same rates as before. i want to make sure everyone is feeling as safe as possible. this will definitely be not be like it was before.
__________________________________________________________________________
3:14 pm: is there anything you can share about the increase in deaths? is this a trend that will continue?

governor: i sure hope not. this is a lagging indicator of what's actually happening throughout the state. hospitalizations are a much better indicator. 
____________________________________________________________________________
3:16 pm: clarification on the death rate that was mentioned. do you believe that we'll continue to be below the models?

amy acton: i think that this is a reporting issue that i'll look into

governor: we'll look into this.

models can only do so much. the original models were based on no mitigations and the newer ones focused on certain amounts of social distancing. 

amy acton: numbers are being updated at 2 pm and i think that's the issue. our reality is that we're going to stay at this rate of infection and hospitalization. deaths are going to lag behind everything else.
__________________________________________________________________________
3:21 pm: do you believe our sports will reopen in the summer or the fall?

governor: i don't know.
_______________________________________________________________________________
3:23 pm: when will you be signing the order regarding nursing homes? is there a regional reopening plan?

amy acton: i believe we're still preparing it and i'll sign it as soon as possible.

governor: unfortunately, we have to have the lawyers involved regarding that order.

i've spoken to the governors of surrounding states. we have no formal plan but we're definitely communicating, including in a call i had this morning.

amy acton: i've been communicating with departments of health throughout the country. we're working together to get this done.

since the cares act passed i've been reading it over and apparently the 10% penalty for withdrawing 401k early is being waived.
i understand i have to pay taxes on this, federal and state level, i understand that federal taxes can be split across 3 years.  
i also understand that retirement is important and i am just pulling as much cash to the sidelines based on my own financial analysis.  i wanted to do this before the layoff, and the market crash : / , but the rules prevented that while i was employed...well...now i'm not and the market has rebounded a bit.   

i have the withdrawal form printed , signed, and ready to sent to my plan holder.  
but, i had a thought.  
will ohio unemployment consider my 401k withdrawal to be income and negate (fully or partially) my unemployment benefits? 

good luck to everyone!",ihategeeks,4,176

681,ohio,[ohio] unemployment issues. breaking claims and pending zero.,"so the past 4 days 7am till 7pm i have been non stop calling. i've had multiple issues. i wasn't employed starting march 13th. filed for unemployment march 27th. put in two separate claims (both on sunday) for the 4th of april and for the 12th of april.i still had nothing. claim view shows pending with $0 and as you know its a hassle to get a hold of someone. i did get lucky 2 times. one time on april 15th, when attempting to call, i pressed 1 for english, pressed 4 for further questions, and then pressed 8 for further questions. took me way too many phone calls to count. the first time i got through i explained to the person that my correspondence inbox had a red envelope that had me fill out information about my college. also, i had those 2 pending claims with $0. she said that i filled everything out correctly and claimed to have fixed the situation and that tomorrow (april 16th) i should see my money back payed for both claims and it will take 1-2 days to go into my direct deposit.......well, that was not the case. i wake up april 16th (today) to see yet another correspondence letter has been applied. this one says ""ui initial allowed"" and when i ooked at my pending $0 claims, they have now stated that both are ""break in claim"" with $0. so today i called at 7am. called about 30 or more times with the method i had. got through luckily, and was told that ""this is odd"" and eventually that person had me giving them all my information again. i also had to re-do my whole application with her asking me questions. now, at the end of all this it had been about 30 minutes or a little more of talking, exchanging, and giving personal information. she then tells me once again (like the last phone call) that tomorrow i will get my back pay and it will take 1-2 business days to go into my account. nothing was explained about how my claim will look because she said i won't see anything until the next day (over night) from when we just talked. so far my claims still say ""break claim"" and still at $0. my correspondence inbox still resume to be stating that there is a ""ui initial allowed"" that i can't open. so i will just wait until tomorrow again. like i said, i have been at this for 4 days non-stop and its literally mentally draining and i need income like everyone else. my problem is like, dude i've gotten through 2 times. i've been told its fixed 2 times. if it doesn't work this time..... do i keep trying? i don't know if anyone else had a problem like this. as of now i'm crossing my fingers and i'm mentally defeated and disturbed from that man's dam voice telling me they are experiencing high call volumes. any advice? or is there someone with the same experience that can let me know of this has happening to them? feel free to reach out. thanks.",gabora94,8,525

725,ohio,say things do start to open may 1ish,"this is something i've been thinking about a lot, as it very well could impact my wife and our household income.  if the process of things opening begins come may 1st, we all know this will carry with it a lot of precautions/restrictions. how many people may go back and end up getting less hours than before.  my wife is a hair stylist and with distancing requirements they will only be able to have a limited number of people working. she could end up getting half her normal hours/pay or less.  getting back to work is great, but people could still be in the position of not being able to make ends meet. we both want her to be on unemployment the shortest time possible, but at least with the additional money from the care act it makes us whole on her income.  if people end up in this situation they will not be eligible for any assistance from the act. the unemployment does have a provision for partial unemployment for people who lose hours, but that seems to be less than useful. it is no longer eligible once you make half of your weekly benefit,  which will likely happen for most.  

unless i have missed it, i haven't seen this addressed anywhere. i emailed both the governor and lt. governor offices regarding it on monday.  so far i have only heard back from the governor's office with a generic form letter about that he has consulted with experts.  it was fairly obvious his staff member likely didn't read the email.

728,ohio,today's experience with calling unemployment,"i've been calling a lot since this morning (the 1-877-644-6562 #). i've found that once the automated message begins press ""2"" then you can press 1,3,2 in sequence (not too quickly) and it will get you to the long automated message. i've also found that the automated message seems to repeat 2x before letting you know if you will need to call back. this makes each call approximately 3 minutes long before you know if you need to hang up. 

as for who i have spoken to today, i have only been able to get ahold of people who can assist with pin resets (not what i need help with). the first person said she would transfer me to a live agent when available and when she did it pretty much dropped the call. the second person said she was only able to help with pin resets and needed to place me back in the queue. which essentially dropped the call.

732,ohio,tell dewine that it's enough..,"40 days ago an arguably reasonable decision was made based on bad data to effectively shut down a society and an economy in the name of ""flattening the curve"" on a potential disease.   since then data has clearly changed.  had we plugged the data we know today into the models we were using 40 days ago, there would have still potentially have been an apex of a curve, however it would have shown a situation that was very manageable.  had our leaders suggested a lockdown with today's information, there would have been anarchy and nobody would have stood for it.

well, now we are at today on the tail of being locked in our homes for 6 weeks in front of media and politician-induced fear porn and we've turned into a bunch of scared sheep who will accept nothing short of eradicating this thing altogether before possibly thinking about opening back up.   people are cowering around in masks, kids are missing their senior years, sports are gone, businesses are shuttering - for what?  for something the likes of which comes around only once in a - well, once in every day.  we accept similar things to covid-19 every day of our lives.

752,ohio,"east coast vs midwest ""nice""","i go to a university on the east coast. one thing i've noticed is the difference between someone being ""nice"" on the east coast means something wayyyyy different than being ""nice"" in the midwest.

i think for most midwesterners, being ""nice"" on the east coast is the baseline of how you treat another person. anything above that, something i wouldn't have to ask of friends in the midwest is something that east coast people don't even think of doing-- for instance-- helping a friend move, picking up a friend from the airport, stuff like that. they just don't seem to consider what's going on in someone's life that they could help out with. that's something i would think of as selfish or rude here, but something i just have gotten used to there. they aren't mean, and when i point out that they could've done this or that for someone, they are never indignant about it, they just honestly hadn't considered it as a possibility.

my dad is local (cincinnati) and my mom is from the east coast. he brought up a great example of this. whenever my mom has something she wants to show us, she calls us into the room and talks about it with us. never comes to us, always has us go to her. my dad will text it or email it to us, or wait until we are in the same room to bring it up. a small thing, but exactly the kind of thing i was thinking of!

757,ohio,rob portman's form letter about impeachment,"i contacted our senator, rob portman, about trump's call with the ukrainian president, and received this form letter. i actually didn't mention impeachment (nor did i express any opinions about trump as the letter immediately assumes), i mentioned that he is the co-chair of the senate ukraine caucus and failing to follow up about information critical to our relationship with ukraine. but no surprise that his office doesn't actually address the concerns of his constituents.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;thank you for contacting my office to express your opinions about president donald trump.    
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;ultimately, we all want our country to succeed. to bring about that success, i believe that i have a responsibility to be an independent voice for ohio.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;the process of impeaching the president, or any government official, is a serious matter and one of the most significant undertakings for the legislative branch. in the case of impeaching an elected official, it is ultimately a decision by congress to overturn the will of the people. this is not something that should be taken lightly and i believe the house of representatives' rush to impeachment is unwarranted, especially as it was done before the transcript of the phone call between president trump and president zelensky and the whistleblower complaint was released.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;i reviewed the transcript of the phone call and the whistleblower complaint. frankly, i do not see the quid pro quo that some have asserted. president trump did not threaten to withhold aid in exchange for anything nor did he link the promise of continued aid to any particular investigation. the whistleblower complaint falls under the jurisdiction of the senate intelligence committee, which has received the complaint and is diligently reviewing it in a bipartisan manner. i believe that this is an appropriate course of action and i look forward to reviewing the results.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;the american people want their elected representatives in congress to get things done for them rather than focus on increasingly partisan investigations. i believe that the impeachment inquiry will distract congress from the bipartisan legislative work we should be doing to find solutions and deliver results for the american people. my focus will remain on working with my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, and with the trump administration, to strengthen our economy, expand retirement security, pass usmca to help ohio farmers, workers, and manufacturers, tackle the opioid crisis, and pursue other priorities for ohio.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;our country faces serious challenges, including the middle-class squeeze, an epidemic of drug addiction, and our growing national security threats. to solve these problems, we need to come together and rise above the dysfunction in washington. i know that if we work together we can deliver results and make a real difference in the lives of ohioans and all americans.

791,ohio,third parties still not to blame for dewine's win,"https://columbusfreepress.com/article/third-parties-still-not-blame-dewines-win

by¬†travis irvine

november 7, 2019

&gt;one year ago, i was the libertarian candidate for governor of ohio in a four-way race. the perfect outcome would have been for myself and the green party candidate, constance gadell-newton, to both receive 3 percent of the vote so we could meet the arbitrary benchmark set by ohio republicans to maintain ballot access for our political parties the next four years. another aspect of this perfect outcome would have been for our total amount of votes to cause republican mike dewine to lose to democrat richard cordray. the ohio republican party has had a stranglehold on our state government for far too long, as evidenced by the aforementioned 3 percent benchmark being set for minor parties and signed into law at all. unlike republicans, democrats have never made ballot access so difficult in ohio, so a cordray administration would have been a welcome change of pace, even for libertarians.

&gt;as we now know,¬†none of these perfect outcomes were achieved. in fact, it was quite the opposite -- both the green and libertarian parties lost ballot access due to the fact that neither constance or i met the 3 percent threshold, although the libertarians have a legal precedent from a court case out of tennessee that gives us a second chance to meet the arbitrary benchmark. but the worst part of last year‚Äôs results was that mike dewine¬†soared¬†to the governor‚Äôs seat over cordray by upwards of 165,000 votes. and while my total of 79,985 votes and constance‚Äôs total of 49,475 votes added together didn‚Äôt even exceed the margin by which dewine won, there are still some political neophytes who think that third parties caused dewine to win.

&gt;this, of course, is an absurd insinuation, although we do see this from arrogant and ignorant political commentators every few years. believe it or not, there are still people in our country who are so far aligned with the left or right within the two-party system that they think only two options should exist when americans look at a ballot. but people who have the courage to vote third party usually don‚Äôt vote democrat or republican anyway. in fact, most studies of election results -- such as libertarian presidential candidate gary johnson‚Äôs total vote count in 2016 -- show that people who vote third party are typically independents or would rather not vote in certain races at all. for example, in 2016 more people showed up to vote for or against the legalization of medical marijuana in florida than the total of people who voted for hillary clinton or donald trump, because many just left the presidential race blank.

&gt;in 2018, my campaign was easily polling better with republicans who didn‚Äôt like dewine leading up to the election -- multiple tea party groups around the state had endorsed me, while other ohio conservative networks were encouraging their supporters to either vote for me or leave the governor race blank. my campaign team knew where our support was coming from and leaned in as much as we could -- we challenged dewine‚Äôs conservative credentials when it came to taxes, spending and gun rights. heck, i even got the endorsement of infamous political trickster and trump ally roger stone! in the days before the election, most polls reflected our efforts, as cordray polled at an average of 48 percent, dewine was at 43 percent and i was at 5 percent -- perfectly making up the margin of dewine‚Äôs potential loss.

&gt;again, we all know how things ended. despite some silly analysis by dumpy know-nothings who still feel the need to troll me on the internet, cordray and the ohio democratic party lost because they no longer have the support of the union-loving, working class voters of the mahoning valley. the ohio electoral map in 2018 was almost identical to when trump won in 2016. dewine and his team deserve credit for the shrewd tactics they used in the days before the election -- not only did dewine get former ohio governor john kasich‚Äôs endorsement, but he also got president trump‚Äôs and held rallies (separately, of course) with both men in different corners of the state. add to this the fact that mike dewine wrote his campaign a check for $3 million the last week before the election, which allowed for an extra half-million dollars to be spent every day on last minute advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts. it was a power play by one of ohio‚Äôs most powerful political hacks and it paid off.

&gt;one year later, most rational political types in ohio can look at the simple electoral math and see that neither my gubernatorial campaign nor the green party‚Äôs gave mike dewine his win in ohio‚Äôs 2018 election. however, for any others who need further explanation, i‚Äôm happy to keep setting the record straight.",pariahdog119,9,810

jones had never been diagnosed with any mental illness. blood samples taken after his arrest showed the presence of only one drug: marijuana.

836,ohio,interactive map with ohio legislative districts shaded by party,"&amp;#x200b;

yesterday i posted a version of this map that - oops - used old data for the legislative district boundaries.  earlier today i found a government gis that has the current legislative district boundary data for ohio so i am reposting.

the date for the house shows district 97 with no color on the map thus indicating a vacant seat.  that is wrong and i have asked the server admin to update their data to show adam holmes (r) representing that district.

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

below is a link to an interactive map i produced.  when the map opens the **ohio state house districts** are displayed with semi-transparent coloring (red=r, blue=d).  the data for the map is hosted on a gis server operated by the state.  i am \*assuming\* the data is current.

to change the map so it shows the **ohio state senate districts**:

1. click the basemap button (next to the ""menu"" button)

2. look under the ""overlay"" heading (mobile users scroll down)

3. click the house layers to turn them off

4. click the senate ""fill"" layer and then the senate ""boundary"" layer.

it may take a few seconds for the data to appear.  it depends on how busy the gis server is and the speed of your internet connection.  

the map is displayed by gissurfer which is a general purpose web map i developed as a public service and part of my way to ""pay it forward"".  there is a **""map tips""** link in the upper left corner with some general ‚Äòhelp' information.

hello history pundits!

solon, ohio is a town outside of cleveland with a lot of history. founded in the 1820's by lorenzo solon bull, jason robbins and their families along with other pioneers of the western reserve, solon has grown into a bustling town of 24,000 and counting today. the residents are a mix of longtime locals and new immigrants from far and wide, all mixing together to create a diverse and proud solon community.

however, we have an issue with our local government. for the past 20 years or so, they've been proving their incompetence time and time again. aside from the rumors of corruption and under the table deals which i have no proof of, the city has made countless bad decisions in terms of spending tax money and developing properties, often to the chagrin of residents. these decades of wasted tax dollars have resulted in countless historical properties being torn down and lost forever, most of which were replaced with drive thru fast food places, tacky shopping centers, or even just vacant lots. talk about leading us into the future...

in comes the lynch house, named after its most recent owner. built in 1905 right on solon's public square, this house has served as a historic relic that defines solon's downtown. the house was home to many important early solonites, and served as a place of wholesome memories that the people of solon hope to preserve for the future. the house was purchased by the city in 2005 for virtually nothing, and was used to house the fire department while their new building was under construction. after 15 years of neglect by the city, the house has some extensive damage that needs to be repaired. luckily, the solon historical society has more than 3x the amount needed to cover repairs in the bank, so money is not an issue here. the issue comes with the city government, who for some reason wants to see this historic house torn down. they have rejected offers to sell the house to someone else, proving that their interest is solely with the piece of property itself. despite years of protest from the public, the city council voted to move into an emergency vote regarding the house last week, and **to the sudden surprise of solon residents they voted short 3-2 to save the house, leaving out 2 council members who were prevented from voting due to their affiliation with the historical society** (complete bs)**, and because they couldn't get the mandatory 4 votes to save the house, it is now slated for demolition.**

**the 2 councilmen who voted against saving the house should not be the ones to call shots on this matter**. there's an entire community of people who have expressed for years that they are willing to put the time and money into fixing this house. the historical society's plans are to turn this house into a second museum, being right next to the historical society museum housed in the old town church. every year, the 3rd graders from the solon elementary schools are taken on field trips to the historical society where they learn about the local history and get a hands on experience that they otherwise would possibly never receive. it's a shame that this is what was voted against by our incompetent government.

this monday, 2/3, there will be a council meeting where local solonites plan on protesting and expressing their concerns to the city. a petition has been created, and is currently at about 1000 signatures. however, we need more and are desperate as time is running out. please show your support by signing the petition, thus helping to save one of the last pieces of our town's history still standing! thanks so much!

**why i‚Äôm voting to acquit president trump**

impeachment will end in the senate. it‚Äôs time to take up consensus issues.

by rob portman
mr. portman is a republican senator from ohio.
feb. 5, 2020, 5:00 a.m. et

on wednesday i will join a majority of my senate colleagues in opposing the impeachment of president trump brought by the house of representatives.

for four months, since the release of the memorandum of the call between president trump and president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine, i have consistently said that mr. trump‚Äôs request for an investigation of joe biden and any effort to tie the release of military aid to investigations were improper and shouldn‚Äôt have happened. however, i do not believe these actions rise to the level where it would be necessary to remove a president from office.

the founders intended for impeachment to be extremely rare, and they required those seeking to remove the president to meet the burden of proving ‚Äúhigh crimes and misdemeanors,‚Äù like treason or bribery. in this case, unlike in other impeachments, no crime was alleged. although there may be circumstances where a crime isn‚Äôt necessary for a president to be impeached, to be impeached under such a circumstance would require meeting an even higher bar, and it wasn‚Äôt met here.

in addition, the house engaged in a rushed process that lacked fundamental fairness. the constitutional law professor jonathan turley calls it ‚Äúthe shortest proceeding, with the thinnest evidentiary record, and the narrowest grounds ever used to impeach a president.‚Äù it was also the only purely partisan impeachment in history.


rushing an impeachment case through the house without due process and giving the senate a half-baked case to finish set a dangerous precedent. if the senate were to convict, it would risk making this kind of quick, partisan impeachment in the house a regular occurrence. that would serve only to further deepen the divides that seem to permeate every part of our society today.

people certainly see this divide in congress. many believe their elected representatives on both sides of the aisle have lost sight of what‚Äôs important and are focusing on politics and partisanship rather than results for the american people.

while the senate is where this impeachment process will end, it is also the senate that is best suited to help turn the page and begin a new chapter. we can do that by demonstrating that we can work together and address the issues our constituents care most about. i believe it is possible for both parties to come together for consensus solutions on these three issues:

lowering prescription drug costs. researchers are producing life-changing medicines, but all that progress does us no good if they‚Äôre unaffordable. it‚Äôs gotten so bad that some americans have to choose between paying their mortgage or rent and being able to afford expensive prescription drugs. in the senate, three committees have approved legislation intended to help lower out-of-pocket costs for senior citizens, crack down on the high prices set by drug manufacturers and end surprise billing practices that have devastated families with shocking medical bills. the house has its own plan. the president wants to get this done and there is no reason we should not be able to find common ground here.

improving skills training. everywhere i go in ohio, employers tell me they need workers who have the skills to fill available jobs ‚Äî well-paying work as welders, coders and health care technicians, all of which require skills training. i‚Äôm working with senator tim kaine, a virginia democrat, to pass legislation called the jobs act to ensure that pell grants can be used to cover short-term training programs for these careers. that would help fill well-paid, in-demand jobs and get more people off the sidelines and into our economy. this legislation is bipartisan, and ready to go.


combating the addiction crisis. one area where congress has worked well together is in combating the opioid epidemic. significant new federal investment since 2016 is making a difference. overdose deaths fell nationwide last year, the first time that‚Äôs happened in nearly three decades. despite this progress, synthetic opioids like fentanyl remain a huge problem, and we‚Äôve seen a resurgence of psychostimulants like crystal meth and cocaine. we‚Äôre working on bipartisan legislation to address these deadly threats.

and there‚Äôs more we can do, from infrastructure to retirement security to protecting our national parks. if congress acts we can begin to re-instill faith in our institutions and bridge the growing partisan divide. in these highly partisan times, it‚Äôs easy for both sides of the aisle to retreat even further into their ideological camps. but for the sake of the country, let‚Äôs look for what unites us instead.",harry-package,6,923

i also don‚Äôt like that crimes like white crimes crimes are included in the sentence reduction clause. it smells of special interest groups, but maybe that‚Äôs just me. 

this brings to question is it ok to vote for policy you don‚Äôt 100% support? at what point is it not good to vote yes, at 90% support? 60? 40? i‚Äôm still undecided on my vote and was hoping to hear some of both sides. ",atton2,5,159

881,ohio,voting on issue 1 (or in general),"i‚Äôve seen a few posts entitled ‚Äúvote ___ on issue 1!!!‚Äù or something around those lines and i‚Äôd just like to comment on these types of posts.

i understand the intention between each of these posts, and i think spreading awareness of what issue 1 means is a good thing, but as a young voter who can admittedly be a bit impressionable, this comes across as pushy and if anything, makes me want to not associate myself with whatever viewpoint is being argued. 

people shouldn‚Äôt instruct other people who or what to vote for. the point of voting on issues is that every person gets an equal say in how things should go. telling someone to vote for what you believe in can come across as a close minded-way of going about it. again, education about the issues is beneficial, as it spreads awareness, but shoving a biased viewpoint in there isn‚Äôt helping anyone.

in parallel, don‚Äôt vote a certain way just because people tell you to! learn the details of what‚Äôs at stake and make a decision based on what you think is best. 

i‚Äôm not in any way trying to slander anyone who has posted anything like this, i‚Äôm just simply stating my viewpoint. happy voting!",jmpiper11,7,208
882,ohio,issue 1 - how about a better solution to our drug epidemic?,"it is clear that something needs to change. what we are doing isn't working. 

i'm not sure reducing felony drug possession (e.g. perscription medication, heroin, cocaine) to a misdemeanor is the answer either. 

i've heard of a program run by judge collier in medina county that has proven results and saved hundreds of lives. 

what about this?

don't change the penalties but change the options. create a program that offers help to addicts who truly want to get clean. 

the year-long program that i suggest goes something like this:

when an addict goes before the judge, he admits to being guilty of the possession charge because being an addict has taken over his/her life and formally requests the courts help. the case against them is suspended while they get the help they need and work towards leading a sober and productive life. if they finish the program, they'll emerge a sober and productive member of society and the case is dropped - completely erased. no record whatsoever. a fresh start.

good start, no?

here is how i suggest going about helping those who want help... i'm sorry, it doesn't include a long rehab. 

1. detox - anyone who enters the program gets a chance to go to a detox facility to make the first few days a little more livable. (people actually die from detoxing!) this isn't a 30 day program - it's supervised by trained medical staff but not a comfortable experience. its detoxing, it sucks. no drugs. 

2. upon release from the detox facility, the patient is given 72hrs to find a fulltime job. if the patient does not find a full time job (36hr/week min), one will be provided for them (cleaning up litter and roadkill for instance) until they are able to find their own. the money made at their job is all theirs to keep and cleaning up the streets pays less than mcdonalds. 

3. the patient must live in a place that is 100% conducive to their recovery. no alcohol or drugs permitted and submit to random searches as part of the program.

4. participants agree to unlimited random drug and alcohol screenings.

5. participants agree to attend 12 step type meetings on a daily basis for the first 6months and 5 days a week for the second half of the program. 

6. participants who successfully complete 6 months of sobriety within the program are assigned new patients to mentor/coach. this helps both parties by giving the new patient a relatable voice and the successful patient an important responsibility.

7. any participant who fails the program is kicked back to the beginning and given a second chance to tackle their own sobriety with help from their local government/court system. those who fail twice go back to the judge to face the consequences of their original crime - forced sobriety/hard time. 

8. participants who successfully complete the 12 month program are cut loose, no probation or reduced charges - a clean slate for a clean individual. 

i know this program works because it's been implemented in my local jurisdiction with phenomenal results. 

we spend less on incarceration. we don't send addicts to long term treatment facilities where they sober up in comfort - nothing worth anything is easy. we spend the savings from reduced incarceration on the detox facilities and screenings. the 12 step programs are proven and offered within 25miles of everywhere. 

i see this as a more compassionate way to combat our drug epidemic. it allows those who truly want to become sober to get there and assists them, on multiple levels, throughout their journey. it does not reduce severe penalties for carrying severely dangerous drugs. it does not let addicts off the hook or allow for a ""one foot in, one foot out"" mentality that so many addicts display at long term rehabilitation facilities that produce lackluster results - it's all or nothing, get sober or go to jail. 

curious as to what you think. 

i'll personally be voting against issue 1 because i don't think it's the answer to our problem and would go so far as to call it a foolish and dangerous proposition. 

do as you will, this is my two cents. 
do you like the idea?",deputydoodah,12,708
883,ohio,any suggestions for 3rd party governor choices?,"dewine and cordray are bought puppets representing both parties.  i can't vote for either of them.  i don't vote for the lesser of two evils or for most likely to win.

884,ohio,anyone have any experience with ohio bear species?,"for some context, i live in clermont near the brown county border. visited a buddy not too long ago in brown county and we saw a bear while out hiking in his woods.

it was fairly dark out, so i couldn't make out too much as far as features go, but the loud snarling and fairly big outline were enough to make us shake in our boots.

jim renacci has responded exactly once, regarding election security. and in that response, he said he is not on the right committees to do anything. you don't have to be on a committee to share your consituents needs with your peers. if he and his staff can't handle our district, don't expect him to try to listen to the whole state. anyway, vote tomorrow if you haven't already!",elkirbydiablo,6,147

887,ohio,all electronic/touch screen voting starting next year?,"so i just voted. i always choose a paper ballot. they told me to be aware paper ballots are ending with this election and ohio voting will be touch screen only in the future.

all voting should be paper nationwide. hacking and tampering is next to impossible. there is a paper trail.

890,ohio,i couldn't vote today...,"so i worked all day and thankfully got off in time to head to my polling station. when i got there i learned i never updated my new address, (muskingum co) so i was still registered to vote at my old address in the neighboring county (perry co). the location where i went had me fill out a form to change my address, but said it was too late for me to vote or go to the board of elections. they told me to go to my neighboring county, which i did. i was promptly told that i could not vote there, makes sense, and had to travel back to where i came. so is this normal? or is it an attempt to thwart young voters like myself?

892,ohio,pronunciation and colloquialism questions (sw/central west ohio related),"i lived in ohio the first 23 years of my life and always just accepted there was nothing unique (comparatively and stereotypically) about my general standard american/newscaster accent. for reference, i grew up in springboro but my parents and almost my entire extended family are from the wapakoneta/lima area. 

living in other places since then, i've noticed two quirks with my speech:

1. my family and i pronounce the 'mea' in 'measure' like 'may' (instead of 'meh')
2. my family and i call a vacuum cleaner a 'sweeper' 

i've been called out for both of these things by ohioans from other parts of the state and non-ohioans alike--is this a 'thing' or is my family just weird?

theme: surprise

(please note: while risk! like to offer a theme as a launching point for storytellers to brainstorm around, we are much more interested in great stories than we are stories that adhere closely to said theme. alternate theme ideas might be ""what was i thinking?"" or ""secrets."")

i am reaching out to you because i found your contact information while looking up storytelling and comedy organizations in your area. i am hoping you can encourage the storytellers, comedians and performers in your community to pitch us their stories for the chance to perform in our live show.

risk! is a live show and podcast ‚Äúwhere people tell true stories they never thought they‚Äôd dare to share in public‚Äù hosted by kevin allison, of the legendary tv sketch comedy troupe the state. risk! has featured people like janeane garofalo, lisa lampanelli, kevin nealon, margaret cho, marc maron, sarah silverman, and regular folks from around the world, dropping the act and showing a side of themselves we‚Äôve never seen before. the risk! podcast gets over a million downloads each month. slate.com called it ‚Äújaw-dropping, hysterically funny, and just plain touching.‚Äù

risk! is not like other storytelling shows. it‚Äôs ‚Äúwhere people tell true stories they never thought they‚Äôd dare to share in public.‚Äù we encourage our storytellers to step out on a limb, be brutally candid and emotionally raw. this is an uncensored show where taboos are tackled and people talk about things they ordinarily might not share in mixed company, but might save for their therapist.

for more information about what we look for in story pitches and how to submit, go to: [http://risk-show.com/submissions/](http://risk-show.com/submissions/)

**send us your pitch by: 1/4/19** **to be considered! pitches@risk-show.com**

935,ohio,can someone help me figure out portman's voting record?,"a few weeks back i saw in the congresisonal record that rob portman had voted against a clause in a joint resolution that would have prevented us aircraft from refueling saudi aircraft in their strikes on yemen. i contacted his office, which assured me he had voted for the measure.

looking into the record, it became clear portman's office was being less than fully honest. he did vote for joint resolution 54, but against the clause that gave it teeth. so i wrote him about the dishonesty. here's what i just got back:

&gt;this resolution stated clearly that crown prince mohammed bin salman is responsible for the murder of jamal khashoggi and urged the government of the kingdom of saudi arabia to ensure appropriate accountability for all those responsible. it also strongly urged the saudi-led coalition to lead the effort in negotiating an immediate ceasefire in yemen and take concrete steps toward ending this humanitarian crisis. i was proud to support this resolution as it passed the u.s. senate on december 13th, the same day that it was introduced.

yeah, he voted for it, along with 98 other senators, so it's not like it was a brave stance. but take a look at the [agenda] (https://www.senate.gov/legislative/lis/roll_call_lists/vote_menu_115_2.htm) the *previous* day.  portman voted against the motion to let the resolution proceed.

what am i missing? how can portman claim to be in support of this when he voted not only against the only actual action called for in the resolution, but also against even going forward with the vote? can someone better versed in civics walk me through this?",seamonkeydoo2,9,267

so i figured... i‚Äôll ask the people who live there. getting other people‚Äôs impressions might make it a bit more caricature, but hell, it‚Äôs worth a try.

so eastwood falls is (currently) roughly around washington county. population somewhere between 5-10k: i‚Äôll narrow it in as i go. all the pictures of the woods i‚Äôve seen there look right. anybody here that‚Äôs from that general area, or geographically similar areas around the river, can i pick your brain? i‚Äôm looking for anything and everything on what small towns are like there, and what small town life is like there. general demographics, industries, culture, etc. what sorts of businesses you have there that are unique, whether franchise or local. what are the people like around there? tell me about the things you like to do that relate to your home. just unload anything you think may be relevant; i need everything i can get.

the reason why i think ohio sucks is firstly for michigan pride. our states are like rivals and i have to stay loyal. whether it be ohio state vs michigan or michigan state or the toledo war when ohio was completely stupid and gave us an entire peninsula full of iron, lakes and beautiful views for a ghetto town.

ohio cops. if anyone from michigan knows anything about ohio is that their cops suck. if they see you going 4 mph over the speed limit they will ticket you 100% of the time. i can do 10 over the speed limit in my home state no sweat. i have even done it behind a cop that was speeding once.

good things about ohio: 
-maybe cedar point (overrated in my opinion)
-planes
-neil armstrong

 bad things: 
-road construction
-they call themselves the mother of presidents egotistically when virginia has had the most presidents. also people from ohio reading this... you have had 7 presidents. not 8.
-unusual amount of serial killers and notorious criminals
-political war state
-boring and ugly
-road construction 
-people are very bland. lots of divorce, bad families, bad communities/society, just rather depressing and boring state.

my biological father and his side of the family are from ohio. he lives in michigan, but the rest of his family lives in ohio. he met my mother when he was first living here in michigan. they both went to live with his mom for a bit, and my older brother was born there. (he‚Äôs a whole different story). they moved back to michigan shortly after. two years pass, and i am born. i was told from a young age that my father is from ohio, and so is my brother. being a young, stupid, naive kid, i did not know it was such a bad thing. until my father decides for us to go visit his family in ohio. 

boy. nothing can prepare you for the moment you realize your dad and brother are from ohio. this god damn shit hole of a state. how could i be related to such, such.. trash. the mental pain i have endured from witnessing ohio first hand, and knowing my own family, my own family, is from ohio. 

what‚Äôs worse, is that i did the math.
dad-100%ohio
mom-100%michigan
me-50/50.
i cried. i still cry. i‚Äôm half retarded. 
for the first several weeks after my realization, i couldn‚Äôt sleep. i couldn‚Äôt eat. eventually i got out of that, and just started to repress the trauma i‚Äôve endured. that was fine until the latter part of my teens. that‚Äôs when the nightmares started. every one of them the exact same. i am blindfolded and there is screaming. then the blindfold comes off and there are two buckeyes with a gun. they shoot me. i wake up.
i couldn‚Äôt handle the dreams, so i started experimenting with drugs. 
within a month i was doing the hard stuff.

guys, i gotta vent. so i donate blood fairly regularly through the red cross. i have a fairly useful blood type and i like the chance to burn 600 calories through replenishing the blood i donate. 

the problem is, the red cross now sends an email a few weeks after each donation notifying me where the blood was sent. this is supposed to make donors feel like they are helping real people, but i am not saving real people; i am enabling the continued existence of ohioans. you can imagine the dismay i felt upon finding out that yet another donation was sent to cleveland.

this must stop. this goes against my values, and i‚Äôd like to have a say in where my very personal donation is sent. it‚Äôs a matter of personal choice and bodily autonomy. there does not appear to be a way to exclude certain areas from receiving my blood. does anyone have advice for ensuring that a blood donation stays out of ohio, preferably north of that hellscape? i don‚Äôt care if they pour it down the drain, i just don‚Äôt want that place benefitting from my selflessness.
