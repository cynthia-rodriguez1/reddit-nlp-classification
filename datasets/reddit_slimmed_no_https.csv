so i recently visited ohio. very briefly, i‚Äôll give it that. i was driving from chicago to erie, pa. i stopped in cleveland for a bit. i thought i‚Äôd just stick to the highway because all i‚Äôve ever heard my whole life is ‚Äúomg cleveland is a shithole!!1‚Äù

i actually had to make a few stops in the city and was pleasantly surprised by cleveland. driving along the lakeside and seeing the skyline was very magical. then there‚Äôs churches and old houses everywhere. and when i researched it more- cleveland has a subway ! and it has a national park! holy cats! like- it has all this and people want to act like the city is garbage?

anyway i‚Äôve recently looked into all the ohio cities and columbus, cincinnati also seem dope as well- 

and yet all i ever hear is people making jokes about ohio. on reddit, on tik tok- a girl at work i know lives in ohio (remote work) and she‚Äôs always saying negative things about.

and while all this is happening i‚Äôm seriously considering a move to the west side of cleveland i liked it that much. public (albeit limited) transport that takes you to downtown and the airport. cheap rent, walkable, and can get to the lake. i feel like cleveland is the kind of place people are looking for in america these days but no one wants to give it a chance.

71,ohio,clevelanders perspective on cincinnati,"born and raised in ne ohio and recently just lived in cleveland for a couple years. i was under the impression that cleveland was nicer than cincy! well, i'm only going off of a weekend trip to the queen city but damn i really like cincy! my gf and i parked off of mcmicken and basically walked all down race into down town then cut across the river front to get on the purple people bridge. we got lunch at pompilios in newport then walked over to covington, across the roebling bridge and then up vine st. to our car.

some standouts:

* over the rhine is a beautiful neighborhood. in cleveland half that neighborhood would be surface parking lots. it honestly might be one of the prettiest neighborhoods in the us.
* purple people bridge and roebling bridge are so amazing. my gf and i both lived in brooklyn and love walking across the brooklyn bridge so getting to see another roebling bridge is such an amazing experience
* newport and covington are such nice towns. loved the area right around the roebling bridge especially the bookstore
* findlay market area is wonderful and the fact that there isnt a sea of asphalt around it makes it feel like a real urban market
* light rail/protected bike lanes
* deeper roots coffee. had the cherry cordial twice! once in the morning and then again on the walk back to our car.
* washington park. there was a farmers market going on and it was just a beautiful green space that we could have hung out for hours in.
* rhinegeist brewery. speaks for itself. mysterious ascent up staircase gives way to a really cool lot level that was a big surprise. great beer as an rooftop as well.
* bookstores. i think we went into three bookstores on out walk and each was distinct in its own way. love that cincy is so walkable for shop browsing.
* pompilios is great italian american food and huge portions!
* underground railroad history. cant wait to visit the underground railroad freedom center on our next trip. we stayed at a underground railroad bed n breakfast north of the city and the history was quite informative and powerful. would love to learn more on our next trip.

room for improvement

* the area around 71 and the stadiums kinda sucks. the entire walk was fun except for the area near the freeway and the reds stadium. was starting to lose hope until we finally got the purple people bridge. once we got there is was gravy for the most part. the river front park looked really nice from the bridge though!
* a train linking cleveland to cincy would be amazing. so sad that it got scrapped a decade ago. the drive isnt bad but taking a quick train would be even better. and your light rail would help move people from the station to wherever they need to go.
* curious if there were plans to expand the light rail. would be so cool to have it go across the river in covington and newport.
* there's a cool looking theatre on mcmicken and mohawk that looks like it could be restored. seemed like the neighborhood could support a small community movie theatre.

87,ohio,young voters in this state need to actually go out and vote in the next election.,"when i went to vote on tuesday, i was the only non senior citizen in my polling place. i knew the turnout rate for younger people is usually low, but i really didn't expect for literally everyone there except me to be 70+ years old. there were about 10,000 votes in one primary and 7,000 votes in the other. that's a **tiny** amount and a few votes would have made a huge difference. i'm honestly a little disappointed in other people my age because they say they care so much, yet when it comes to actually going out and voting, nobody shows up. we had a fairly moderate candidate running in the republican primary for state central committee (the democratic race was unopposed) and he lost. had a few thousand more young people showed up and voted for him, he would have won. it's unsettling to think about the fact that people who won't live long enough to see the consequences of their voting are the ones with the highest turnout. they don't care about climate change because they won't be around for the worst of it. they don't care about abortion access because they're too old to get pregnant. they don't care about workers' rights because they're already retired with a pension. we need to do better and i really hope to see more 18-25 years olds at my polling place in november. this state has the numbers to turn itself around if all the adults who can vote actually did.",fillmorecounty,16,252

109,ohio,moving to ohio -- akron specifically," 

my wife (31f) and i (30m) moved to boise from louisiana in 2017 and have really enjoyed ourselves but it's time to move on. the city's growth is ridiculous, housing is absurd, and my wife and i don't make terribly much money (above median household, but not by that much).

we are looking to move somewhere, and, as crazy as this sound, akron checks almost every box statistically. i've read that akron is awesome, and i've also read that it is a shithole. i doubt it's as awesome as boise and i doubt it's as big a shithole as our hometown (alexandria, la), so i am good with somewhere in the middle.

i'm okay if the town is stagnant. i'm an accountant, and i feel like between akron, cleveland, and canton i can find work somewhere. my wife has a work from home job and one of their locations is in canton so she is eligible to transfer.

this might be weird, but we don't want somewhere that's growing. we just spent the last half a decade in a town where the growth was so much it was unsustainable. we are trying to find a town off the radar of any lists of any sort. our goals are to buy a house and be boring people in a boring town.

we don't have enough cheddar to visit beforehand. we could swing a trip, but we'd rather save the money for setting up shop. we are moving april 2023 when our lease is up.

i guess my general questions are:

i'm an accountant, but i'll need a general job when i get there before looking for work if i don't land a position while in boise. i know amazon has a presence, but any local companies that churn employees or expect high turnover?

how bad are the winters? i'd eventually like to be snowed in. after 25 years of heat in louisiana, boise is not nearly cold enough. what are the chances i'm holed up with nothing to do for weeks at a time?

is the local population nice? i'm tired of nice people. everybody here is so goddamn nice and bubbly it makes me want to vomit. will people ignore us, generally?

repeat of the op, but how does the city feel? we would like an area where it feels like it will never truly be on the upswing. not to say there aren't good things, but is it a place where people will say 'why in the world would you move here?'

how big are the universities presence (kent/akron) and do they bleed into all parts of the city? there are so many bsu students here (i was one just a year ago) and i'd like to know pockets of the city where the populace is older.

property management companies to avoid like the plague?

any good food places?

also, any other info is appreciated. i hope this doesn't come off as miserable, i just get seasonal affective disorder in the summer and it feels like it's rained not at all here for the past 3 months. we aren't miserable people, we are tried of feeling like people won't stop smiling at us every time we pass them on the street.

tonight, me, my wife and daughter went out to dinner.

we go in, we order and my daughter goes to the bathroom.

she comes back, pale as a ghost, and is bawling. 

my wife gets out of her that she just saw her rapist. he was working as a cook in the restaurant.

my daughter was ""date raped"" a year ago. long story short, my daughter wasn't mentally able to go to trial after his defense attorney indicated there would be a jury trial and a ton of the prosecutions case depended on my daughters testimony. 

a deal was struck and due to his age (literary by two weeks at the time) he's not on the predator list. 

he did some jail time, 3 years of probation, and a 5 year civil protection order. he has to maintain 500' of distance. no direct or indirect contact. no unsupervised contact with juveniles.  

back to tonight, when my daughter came out, we got up and left. 

we ordered about $65 worth of food and i feel bad about leaving.

the more i thought about it, the more it seemed like he was told he had to retreat if we came into a place he worked. 

so, i'm thinking i should have said something to the manager or the waitress, something as to why we left.

i think ohio should adopt this as a statewide policy for all police. regardless of what you think about the recent police shootings, including jayland walker, high speed chases lead to a greater risk of people getting hurt or killed, especially bystanders, and other people on the road.

i know the answer; changing the law would require the state government to actually care about anything but the status quo and taking rights away from people who aren't male, white and a corporation.

i already gps track myself in case someone accuses me of breaking into their house or something. when i notice a problem person i make sure to get on a public space and i start recording the ground to record the conversation. 

i want to know the laws on recording myself as i walk from house to house with a body camera. i'd like a record of what i actually do, so that if someone catches me off guard a d things get physical i know it's recorded.

the guy who confronted me today was the one time i ever felt uncomfortable due to his persistance and paranoid agreasion...and i've been threatened with being shot and attacked by guard dogs befor in the city....

so what's the law on me recording with a body camera. i don't go in houses. i often interact with people on their property. if someone sees i have a camera on me a d starts complaining i can't record them on their property...is that legit?

i'm a skinny guy. i can't have a weapon at work. i'm not worried if someone calls the cops on me. it's the people who stalk me, and become aggressive no matter what i say who worry me.",cooloutside7601,14,301
225,ohio,stop saying ohio is affordable,"yes, the country on the whole is in a housing crisis.

no, most of ohio is not seeing it to the same degree at the moment. homeownership is still a possibility here without having your rich uncle with no kids croak off and give you his inheritance (maybe you need that rich uncle to buy in columbus, though).

that said, with other metros in the us being unaffordable, the rise in remote work, and a warming planet, we will likely see an influx of people in the coming decades.

which will cause housing prices to rise, and low availability.

some might see that as a positive. especially those who already own a home. but having out-of-towners swarm here is going to cause the same housing issues that are already infecting other parts of the country (not to mention the traffic, the smog, and other issues this creates that reduces quality of life).

and this isn't just a west coast problem. look at the raleigh and denver metros. 20 years ago, buying there was a relative breeze for those earning a decent wage. now that everyone is moving to those locations, the average local with a good job can no longer afford to buy.

is this what we want in ohio? a housing market that is exploding, while wages stay the same?

if this becomes the case, the people who buy today will make out like bandits, but anyone who couldn't buy today (like, 12 year olds), will face a new reality where they are 32, college degree and a good job, but no ability to afford a house.

tldr: if we keep telling people it's cheap here, it will stop being cheap here.",smartnsad,5,283

more to the point, get off ya lazy assess and protest! like in real life. burn the politicians houses down if you have to. teachers are the new god, we as parents have no say. period.
when you are successful and every kid wants to be lgbt and/or black.. the world will be a much much better place. 

obviously.

i'll be home schooling my kids personally but eh.
seriously stop complaining on the web goofballs. these kids can't learn about the struggles of the blacks and lgbt people through reddit.

our preferences if we were to buy a home in ohio: budget is $300,000 for a single family home, quiet+safe neighborhood, lots of yard space for our dog and future children (planning to have 2 kids) to run around on, low to moderate amount of traffic, we don‚Äôt drink so don‚Äôt care much about nightlife or bars, decent schools, and just want to live in a nice, clean, quiet neighborhood. i feel like beavercreek matches our criteria from what i‚Äôve seen on youtube, but we wanted to get direct feedback from people who have lived in beavercreek.

408,ohio,resources for elderly person on the verge of being homeless due to mental illness,"hello ohioans,

i am looking for any advice you may have on social services that might be able to help my aunt, who we believe is on the verge of becoming homeless with brain damage and mental illness. 

my 67-year-old aunt:

* had a stroke 6 years ago which left her somewhat brain damaged
* has some kind of mental illness
* has stage 4 kidney disease, white matter disease, lyme disease and a few other medical issues
* abuses alcohol, cigarettes, and prescription drugs
* refuses services like a medicaid nursing home
* can do some things but doesn't clean up after herself, bathe regularly, manage finances, grocery shop or manage general life things.  
* has delusions about a man that is coming to rescue her from her current situation 
* is very adept at getting prescription drugs/cigarettes/alcohol. somehow her brain works fine for this. 
* is highly self destructive and also destructive to spaces she lives in, relationships, and really anything around her. 
* has almost no income except a tiny amount of ss

she has been kicked out of several senior living facilities because she will not follow the rules - namely  not smoking indoors or only smoking in designated areas.

my parents (also elderly) have been almost full-time taking care of her, babysitting her, cleaning up after her, feeding her, managing her (lack of) finances, and trying to find her housing.  they were able to luckily, with a lot of effort, get her into low income housing recently.  that's good news, but we are reasonably sure she will get kicked out soon because they don't allow smoking indoors and she won't follow any rules.  she also needs to be monitored frequently for basic life needs and not accidentally burning the place down. 

because of her mental illness/brain damage/drug abuse, it's impossible to reason with her or convince her to follow rules.  she just can't comprehend it or doesn't care.  she believes a man she has feelings for is about to come sweep her off her feet and buy her a condo so her behavior doesn't matter anyway. 

my parents quality of life is highly degraded due to having to manage my aunt's life and try to prevent her complete self-destruction.  my aunt absolutely cannot move in with them, and she would be an extreme burden to any person who took her in.  my aunt has also stated that if put into a nursing home she would just walk out.  

my parents called adult protective services hoping they would provide some kind of help to her (such as a caseworker who could get her assistance) as she was getting kicked out of her most recent housing, but after the appointment/interview with my aunt they just gave her a list of low-cost housing options.  (which was absolutely not something she could deal with on her own.)

at this point it feels like there are no other options for if/when she gets kicked out of her new low-income housing and will become homeless.  (even in housing her life is in a quite dire state.) when told this is the end of the road and the next stop is being homeless, she doesn't care because she thinks a rich man is about to buy her a condo. 

it feels like grasping at straws at this point, but i was wondering if anyone had any thoughts about services that could help my aunt - someone who refuses to abide by any rules or accept a medicaid nursing home but is also not mentally well enough to make positive choices for her life or manage her life at all. 

we don't want her to be homeless but we're at the end of the line and are feeling heartbroken. thanks to anyone who read this far.",traveler81,14,633

449,ohio,a place worth exploring.,"if your bored and looking for a quick day trip downtown lancaster has really come alive in the past couple of years. the buildings look amazing and really capture the historical nature of the downtown. you could easily spend the afternoon just taking photos of the streets. there lots of nice shops, good restaurants, and even things to see and do.¬†i'm honestly amazed at the turn around.¬†


there are fun things to do like art&amp;clay where you can paint pottery. the sherman house and georgian are great museums for the mid 1800's. the shoe factory antique mall is an absolutely massive multifloor antique store that is just cool to explore. the decorative arts center of ohio is a really different take on an art museum with different traveling exhibits. there are even 4 art galleries to visit as well. if history and art really arnt your thing you can visit rising park and climb mt pleasant for a truly amazing view.¬†


while there are things to do i think most people visting the downtown will spend thier time in all the little shops. there's the paper back exchange an old book store, pulp reality which is a cool retro comic book and record store ( btw if your a local band this is the place to post concert flyers.) odessey games is a shop devoted to tabletop gaming with tables to play at. a season in time and sparkel &amp; rust both sell that old farm house looking decor that people are really into currently. keller market house has locally made food products and iv seriously been meaning to try double edge brewings locally made beer. this isn't even a tenth of all shops, its really like what old downtowns use to be.¬†


finally the downtown has a crazy amount of good restaurants and pubs to eat at. ale house 1890 and downtown bistro are your more up scale options, maria's is good mexican. ohuids is a pub straight out of ireland. jb's downtown grill, provisions, and bobs backyard bbq are great places for lunch. it's honestly impossible to name all the places to eat and drink there because new places just keep popping up. i suggest you just ask a local what nearby is good.¬†


what was once mostly half empty buildings is now a place the town really wants people to travel to see.¬†this a great place to just walk around with a coffee and explore. i strongly suggest you give it a vist and if you have already been there please tell us what your favorite shop/restaurant was.¬†",jcook311,4,433

she's very fit and extremely mindful of her diet, so i'm turning to you for help. i'm open to other ideas, but i've been wanting to send her a ""treat"" of sorts... something she can splurge on. i've been thinking the vegan version of tiff's treats, and i'd be completely fine with cannabis suggestions (assuming ohio allows for it, unlike my state... although we're getting close). 

will also look online, but i wanted to find any hidden local favorites that might not be on the top results of a google search.

then you try to contact via email and get an auto-repsonse that says  ""please note: any questions asked through email will not receive a response. if you have questions, please call...""

there's my rant....now my question/issue....

i have been receiving unemployment benefits since our restaurant was temporarily shut down back at the end of march(due to covid-19). since we reopened i have been getting some shifts, but still have qualified for partial unemployment due to reduced hours. there were two weeks in a row(3 weeks ago) where i was able to get enough hours that i didn't qualify for a payment.¬†

the following week i was back down to 1 shift of 6 hours(which would have qualified me again). up to this point i have not been required to do the 2 per week job searches. once i hit these two weeks in a row, it now made me reapply and is asking for me to meet the job search criteria.

more than likely, for the forseeable future, i will have 1-2 weeks where hours are below the threshold, then a week where it is above the threshold.

from my understanding, if this was due to the mass layoff because of covid-19, i am not required to do the job search.

with the 2020 election fast approaching, i wanted to share this resource that gives great, nonpartisan information on candidates‚Äô platforms. it is called the youthvoterguide and it is a great resource for young voters in this coming election.¬†

the way the youthvoterguide works is by typing in your zip code and then selecting your congressional district. this will give a side by side comparison of the republican and democrat running for congress in your district. the website gives the candidates‚Äô positions on many issues important to young people such as gun control, climate change, health care, and immigration just to name a few. the youthvoterguide also tells you if the race in your area is contested or not. with this information, voters can compare the closeness of the races in their home district and the district where they go to school and choose to register in the area where their vote will have a larger impact.¬†

ohio is one of the key battleground states of the upcoming election. winners of ohio elections will help determine the course of this country over the next several years. this makes it absolutely necessary to make sure that the young voters of ohio are informed on their candidates‚Äô positions. 

making sure that young voters are informed is just as important as having young people vote in the first place. please help spread awareness of the youthvoterguide so that they can make their right choice on election day.¬†

532,ohio,~ could ohio outlaw political parties ? ~," 

# 

philosophically, is the current political set-up of designated political parties benefiting us ohioans ?

instead of our right hand fighting our left hand, what if we used both hands to help our entire collective body ?

would we all, as human citizens, benefit from being less partisan in one direction or the other ?

what if we were all 'independent ?'

i'm actually thinking that individual affiliation greatly reduces our philosophical options, clear thought processes, and opportunities to use government to quickly react to us.

my path has shown me that the question i propose has a lot of validity.

i understand i have to pay taxes on this, federal and state level, i understand that federal taxes can be split across 3 years.  
i also understand that retirement is important and i am just pulling as much cash to the sidelines based on my own financial analysis.  i wanted to do this before the layoff, and the market crash : / , but the rules prevented that while i was employed...well...now i'm not and the market has rebounded a bit.   

i have the withdrawal form printed , signed, and ready to sent to my plan holder.

will ohio unemployment consider my 401k withdrawal to be income and negate (fully or partially) my unemployment benefits?

599,ohio,say things do start to open may 1ish,"this is something i've been thinking about a lot, as it very well could impact my wife and our household income.  if the process of things opening begins come may 1st, we all know this will carry with it a lot of precautions/restrictions. how many people may go back and end up getting less hours than before.  my wife is a hair stylist and with distancing requirements they will only be able to have a limited number of people working. she could end up getting half her normal hours/pay or less.  getting back to work is great, but people could still be in the position of not being able to make ends meet. we both want her to be on unemployment the shortest time possible, but at least with the additional money from the care act it makes us whole on her income.  if people end up in this situation they will not be eligible for any assistance from the act. the unemployment does have a provision for partial unemployment for people who lose hours, but that seems to be less than useful. it is no longer eligible once you make half of your weekly benefit,  which will likely happen for most.  

unless i have missed it, i haven't seen this addressed anywhere. i emailed both the governor and lt. governor offices regarding it on monday.  so far i have only heard back from the governor's office with a generic form letter about that he has consulted with experts.  it was fairly obvious his staff member likely didn't read the email.

601,ohio,today's experience with calling unemployment,"i've been calling a lot since this morning (the 1-877-644-6562 #). i've found that once the automated message begins press ""2"" then you can press 1,3,2 in sequence (not too quickly) and it will get you to the long automated message. i've also found that the automated message seems to repeat 2x before letting you know if you will need to call back. this makes each call approximately 3 minutes long before you know if you need to hang up. 

as for who i have spoken to today, i have only been able to get ahold of people who can assist with pin resets (not what i need help with). the first person said she would transfer me to a live agent when available and when she did it pretty much dropped the call. the second person said she was only able to help with pin resets and needed to place me back in the queue. which essentially dropped the call.

i think for most midwesterners, being ""nice"" on the east coast is the baseline of how you treat another person. anything above that, something i wouldn't have to ask of friends in the midwest is something that east coast people don't even think of doing-- for instance-- helping a friend move, picking up a friend from the airport, stuff like that. they just don't seem to consider what's going on in someone's life that they could help out with. that's something i would think of as selfish or rude here, but something i just have gotten used to there. they aren't mean, and when i point out that they could've done this or that for someone, they are never indignant about it, they just honestly hadn't considered it as a possibility.

my dad is local (cincinnati) and my mom is from the east coast. he brought up a great example of this. whenever my mom has something she wants to show us, she calls us into the room and talks about it with us. never comes to us, always has us go to her. my dad will text it or email it to us, or wait until we are in the same room to bring it up. a small thing, but exactly the kind of thing i was thinking of!

people shouldn‚Äôt instruct other people who or what to vote for. the point of voting on issues is that every person gets an equal say in how things should go. telling someone to vote for what you believe in can come across as a close minded-way of going about it. again, education about the issues is beneficial, as it spreads awareness, but shoving a biased viewpoint in there isn‚Äôt helping anyone.

731,ohio,issue 1 - how about a better solution to our drug epidemic?,"it is clear that something needs to change. what we are doing isn't working. 

i'm not sure reducing felony drug possession (e.g. perscription medication, heroin, cocaine) to a misdemeanor is the answer either. 

i've heard of a program run by judge collier in medina county that has proven results and saved hundreds of lives. 

what about this?

don't change the penalties but change the options. create a program that offers help to addicts who truly want to get clean. 

the year-long program that i suggest goes something like this:

when an addict goes before the judge, he admits to being guilty of the possession charge because being an addict has taken over his/her life and formally requests the courts help. the case against them is suspended while they get the help they need and work towards leading a sober and productive life. if they finish the program, they'll emerge a sober and productive member of society and the case is dropped - completely erased. no record whatsoever. a fresh start.

good start, no?

here is how i suggest going about helping those who want help... i'm sorry, it doesn't include a long rehab. 

1. detox - anyone who enters the program gets a chance to go to a detox facility to make the first few days a little more livable. (people actually die from detoxing!) this isn't a 30 day program - it's supervised by trained medical staff but not a comfortable experience. its detoxing, it sucks. no drugs. 

2. upon release from the detox facility, the patient is given 72hrs to find a fulltime job. if the patient does not find a full time job (36hr/week min), one will be provided for them (cleaning up litter and roadkill for instance) until they are able to find their own. the money made at their job is all theirs to keep and cleaning up the streets pays less than mcdonalds. 

3. the patient must live in a place that is 100% conducive to their recovery. no alcohol or drugs permitted and submit to random searches as part of the program.

4. participants agree to unlimited random drug and alcohol screenings.

5. participants agree to attend 12 step type meetings on a daily basis for the first 6months and 5 days a week for the second half of the program. 

6. participants who successfully complete 6 months of sobriety within the program are assigned new patients to mentor/coach. this helps both parties by giving the new patient a relatable voice and the successful patient an important responsibility.

7. any participant who fails the program is kicked back to the beginning and given a second chance to tackle their own sobriety with help from their local government/court system. those who fail twice go back to the judge to face the consequences of their original crime - forced sobriety/hard time. 

8. participants who successfully complete the 12 month program are cut loose, no probation or reduced charges - a clean slate for a clean individual. 

i know this program works because it's been implemented in my local jurisdiction with phenomenal results. 

we spend less on incarceration. we don't send addicts to long term treatment facilities where they sober up in comfort - nothing worth anything is easy. we spend the savings from reduced incarceration on the detox facilities and screenings. the 12 step programs are proven and offered within 25miles of everywhere. 

i see this as a more compassionate way to combat our drug epidemic. it allows those who truly want to become sober to get there and assists them, on multiple levels, throughout their journey. it does not reduce severe penalties for carrying severely dangerous drugs. it does not let addicts off the hook or allow for a ""one foot in, one foot out"" mentality that so many addicts display at long term rehabilitation facilities that produce lackluster results - it's all or nothing, get sober or go to jail. 

curious as to what you think. 

i'll personally be voting against issue 1 because i don't think it's the answer to our problem and would go so far as to call it a foolish and dangerous proposition. 

do as you will, this is my two cents.

760,ohio,the risk! live show is coming to cleveland and cincinnati and we are looking for ohio storytellers to pitch their stories.,"my name is brad and i am looking for storytellers in your area to pitch true stories from their lives for consideration to be in the risk! live show that is coming to cincinnati on 2/8/19 @ ludlow garage 

theme: surprise

(please note: while risk! like to offer a theme as a launching point for storytellers to brainstorm around, we are much more interested in great stories than we are stories that adhere closely to said theme. alternate theme ideas might be ""what was i thinking?"" or ""secrets."")

i am reaching out to you because i found your contact information while looking up storytelling and comedy organizations in your area. i am hoping you can encourage the storytellers, comedians and performers in your community to pitch us their stories for the chance to perform in our live show.

risk! is a live show and podcast ‚Äúwhere people tell true stories they never thought they‚Äôd dare to share in public‚Äù hosted by kevin allison, of the legendary tv sketch comedy troupe the state. risk! has featured people like janeane garofalo, lisa lampanelli, kevin nealon, margaret cho, marc maron, sarah silverman, and regular folks from around the world, dropping the act and showing a side of themselves we‚Äôve never seen before. the risk! podcast gets over a million downloads each month. slate.com called it ‚Äújaw-dropping, hysterically funny, and just plain touching.‚Äù

risk! is not like other storytelling shows. it‚Äôs ‚Äúwhere people tell true stories they never thought they‚Äôd dare to share in public.‚Äù we encourage our storytellers to step out on a limb, be brutally candid and emotionally raw. this is an uncensored show where taboos are tackled and people talk about things they ordinarily might not share in mixed company, but might save for their therapist.

to hear some of our stories, go to: http://risk-show.com/listen

for more information about what we look for in story pitches and how to submit, go to: [http://risk-show.com/submissions/](http://risk-show.com/submissions/)

**send us your pitch by: 1/4/19** **to be considered! pitches@risk-show.com**

please let the performers in your community know about this exciting opportunity as soon as you can, and let me know if you have any questions!

thank you,

brad

so i figured... i‚Äôll ask the people who live there. getting other people‚Äôs impressions might make it a bit more caricature, but hell, it‚Äôs worth a try.

so eastwood falls is (currently) roughly around washington county. population somewhere between 5-10k: i‚Äôll narrow it in as i go. all the pictures of the woods i‚Äôve seen there look right. anybody here that‚Äôs from that general area, or geographically similar areas around the river, can i pick your brain? i‚Äôm looking for anything and everything on what small towns are like there, and what small town life is like there. general demographics, industries, culture, etc. what sorts of businesses you have there that are unique, whether franchise or local. what are the people like around there? tell me about the things you like to do that relate to your home. just unload anything you think may be relevant; i need everything i can get.

i‚Äôm from california. that sentence alone says it all, i know.

i‚Äôve been in ohio for coming up to 2 years now. from the start i was told this place was filled with great people, good drivers and just a bunch of awesome things. that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. first of all i‚Äôve been hustling since day one living here, and the ‚Äúsweet midwestern‚Äù attitude is pretty much non existent, people are assholes but like tacky assholes if that makes any sense with no pot to piss in yet still just a fuckinf asshole judging you and your every move, also nosey and racist as fuck. doesn‚Äôt make any sense. 
the drivers are horrific, i‚Äôve never seen such horrible drivers in my life on the easiest roads. how the fuck can people be such shitty drivers here?

the reason why i think ohio sucks is firstly for michigan pride. our states are like rivals and i have to stay loyal. whether it be ohio state vs michigan or michigan state or the toledo war when ohio was completely stupid and gave us an entire peninsula full of iron, lakes and beautiful views for a ghetto town.

ohio cops. if anyone from michigan knows anything about ohio is that their cops suck. if they see you going 4 mph over the speed limit they will ticket you 100% of the time. i can do 10 over the speed limit in my home state no sweat. i have even done it behind a cop that was speeding once.

good things about ohio: 
-maybe cedar point (overrated in my opinion)
-planes
-neil armstrong

 bad things: 
-road construction
-they call themselves the mother of presidents egotistically when virginia has had the most presidents. also people from ohio reading this... you have had 7 presidents. not 8.
-unusual amount of serial killers and notorious criminals
-political war state
-boring and ugly
-road construction 
-people are very bland. lots of divorce, bad families, bad communities/society, just rather depressing and boring state.

(he‚Äôs a whole different story). they moved back to michigan shortly after. two years pass, and i am born. i was told from a young age that my father is from ohio, and so is my brother. being a young, stupid, naive kid, i did not know it was such a bad thing. until my father decides for us to go visit his family in ohio. 

boy. nothing can prepare you for the moment you realize your dad and brother are from ohio. this god damn shit hole of a state. how could i be related to such, such.. trash. the mental pain i have endured from witnessing ohio first hand, and knowing my own family, my own family, is from ohio.

mom-100%michigan
me-50/50.

kid in fortnite shirt hops out and hits that mf blocboy/floss for the entirety of our interaction. the girl is usually a little chonkenstein but stays quiet. i like to think one day she will find happiness far from her hellish home and family. 

the dad opens the door and the car heaves and rebounds as he moves his ass to the edge of the seat, then exits the vehicle. 

he is visibly winded from this short burst of energy and takes a minute to collect his breath before barking at me from under his mustache.

dad adjusts his mickey ears, and brushes crumbs off his dxl generic tee while his autistic son hits that blocboy/yop double gawk combo. 

‚Äúwere from ohio, its -15 degrees at our home right now, we lost our middle son johnny at the start of the winter, we found him catatonic in the back yard come morning time.‚Äù 

it is then i notice the girls 1000 yard stare, as she has known the death of a loved one.

‚Äú32 dollars is a little steep, and i dont remember it being mentioned on the website , may i speak with some management about pricing‚Äù 

me: the front desk handles that sir, they are in and to the right.

guys, i gotta vent. so i donate blood fairly regularly through the red cross. i have a fairly useful blood type and i like the chance to burn 600 calories through replenishing the blood i donate. 

the problem is, the red cross now sends an email a few weeks after each donation notifying me where the blood was sent. this is supposed to make donors feel like they are helping real people, but i am not saving real people; i am enabling the continued existence of ohioans. you can imagine the dismay i felt upon finding out that yet another donation was sent to cleveland.

this must stop. this goes against my values, and i‚Äôd like to have a say in where my very personal donation is sent. it‚Äôs a matter of personal choice and bodily autonomy. there does not appear to be a way to exclude certain areas from receiving my blood. does anyone have advice for ensuring that a blood donation stays out of ohio, preferably north of that hellscape? i don‚Äôt care if they pour it down the drain, i just don‚Äôt want that place benefitting from my selflessness.

2. cops. so many cops just everywhere that drive like dicks.

3. people can't drive worth a shit. i've seen so much more fucked up driving in the last year and a half than i did in 24 years in michigan. 

4. people are a lot more dumb down here than i thought there'd be. 

5. their general views on life is warped as well. it's pretty cringey to hear. 

6. the relationships are really fucked up down here. so far the 6/6 women i've tried to date down here would rather get back with their ex that used them, cheated on them, beat them or some other dumb shit than actually be with someone who doesn't do that kind of shit. (i also see female friends who i have no interest in do literally the same thing and it's mindblowing as to why).

7. the guys try to act so hard down here and it's hilarious. dude, come to detroit sometime and try to act hard, you'll be shit on and put in your place real quick. 

8. there's more selfish people than genuine people. 

9. meth and heroin is rampant down here. it's sad really.
